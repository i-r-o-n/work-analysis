Figure 1. Black Yeast vs. Light Orange Yeast
Comparisons between percentages of Black and Light Orange yeast in populations growing with and without Fungicure. Our study examined yeast of two types (one colored black and one colored light orange) to find which yeast type would survive better in conditions with and without an antifungal antibiotic. Our study concluded that the Light Orange yeast was able to reproduce with greater success in both conditions.?The ten precepts of Buddhism, define Buddhism as a religion of sacrifice used to reach a state without suffering whereas the Ten Commandments of Christianity and Judaism, define the religions are rule-based, where there is a right and wrong way for a person to act. Buddhist practices are to reach a state of no suffering, by not wanting, letting go of connections to material objects, and destroying your ego. Desire is seen as non-acceptance for the creation and destruction of everything because desire is the want for things to stay permanent and not go through the inevitable change all things go through. This is why many of the 10 precepts involve sacrificing wants to reach a wantless existence. 
The ten precepts progress as follows, Abstain from killing. Abstain from stealing. Abstain from misusing sex. Abstain from lying. Abstain from giving or taking drugs. Abstain from discussing the faults of others. Abstain from praising yourself while abusing others. Abstain from sparing the Dharma assets. Abstain from indulging in anger. Abstain from defaming the Three Treasures [Buddha, Dharma, Sangha]. Many of these precepts involve the sacrifice of a human want or tendency rule five, seven, and 8 involve sacrifice to prevent want. The sacrifice of taking drugs, of ego, and of withholding supplies from others are examples of the sacrifice of material things or pleasurable experiences that are commanded in Buddhism. Like Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism share a set of ten commandments, they are, I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth [...]You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.[...]Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you. You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbors wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbors. These ten commandments are said to be the recorded word of God. And although these ten commandments involved religious practices, the majority of these rules define the right and wrong way a person can conduct himself. The first five commandments are commandments that describe a follower should act in accordance with god and religion, but the last five are rules of conduct for everyday life. 
The Buddhist ten commandments and the commandments of Christianity and Judaism share rules. They share rules that forbid killing, stealing, lying, and adultery and a rule that places importance on respecting the positions of others. But there are differences. The Buddist ten Commandments prohibit the use of drugs, whereas the commandments of Christianity and Judaism mention nothing about mind-altering substances. Also in the Christian and Islamic commandments, there is no mention of modesty or talking badly of others besides respecting your mother and father. 
 ?Georges of the jury, today the prosecution presented you with numerous facts that prove that a Homo sapien committed the murder of an innocent Neanderthal and to improve our society, the  Homo sapien who committed this roughness crime should be punished for their actions. The actions of the Homo sapiens can be compared to Columbus crossing the Atlantic in 1492, when he arrived in the Americas, and committed mass genocide, because, in his mind, they were less developed. We dont even know if they were less developed, they couldve had a secretly developed culture. The word human is usually applied only to Homo. Sapien and other members of the genus Homo.
In addition, we heard that at least 4% of our DNA can be directly linked to the Neanderthals, and with this information, we can infer that interbreeding occurred between homo sapiens and Neanderthals. This further proves the point that these two are similar enough to produce fertile children. If we do not have at least a few commonalities, then we would not contain Neathendral DNA. Moreover, Homo neanderthals is part of the genus Homo, or human. Though they may be of a different species, they are still technically human and the murder law applies in the same way it would apply for a sapien.
Researchers from the University of York say that Neanderthals also had emotions and feelings. Should we really say that the friends and family of the Neanderthal did not experience grief? This Neanderthal had a life, a family, friends. As was previously stated, they cared for their sick and injured. They experienced joy, sadness, anger, and all that was ended in a heartbeat, one cruel, thoughtless move, that caused the death of one human being. Furthermore, there are some languages that are more advanced than others but that wouldn't justify genocide. At the time of the murder, humans could not make computers or build wires. Humans at the time were unable to perform significant cognitive tasks that were able to do now. 
After hearing the evidence provided by the prosecution today, I hope that you, George of the jury, find the verdict of the homo sapien in question, guilty of murder, not animal abuse, murder. As the prosecution we have proved evidence that proves the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. It is your responsibility to help us make a fair and just world, and for you to find the verdict of the defendant's guilt will bring us that much closer. ?Coca Cola
Car horns honked, engines groaned, and a bead of sweat fell from her brow, only to be wiped hurriedly away from her rigid jawline. The car jerked to a stop. A bobby pin slid off of the dashboard and landed in the seat next to her. She let out an irritated sigh. 
Dr. Madeline Crane looked ahead, looked at her ticking watch, then looked ahead again. She promptly parked the car, opened the door, and walked to the hood, humming anxiously to herself.
Hey, dont do that! It holds up the cars behind you! said the man in the car behind her.
Well, if you havent noticed, none of the cars have moved for the past fifteen minutes, so my car isnt holding up the cars behind me any more than yours! she said as a vein bulged from her forehead. I have places to be, so I suggest that you leave me alone and carry on with your humdrum and ordinary life.
Excuse me, but maam
Dr. Crane continued humming and laced her fingers together like a ball of yarn about to unwind. She tripped on her way back to the car, got up, irritatedly brushed off the dust from her ironed black dress, and rummaged in the front seat for something. 
The sun beat down on the dusty grey scene, reflecting the shiny metal hubcaps of Dr. Cranes car. She emerged with a bobby pin. She opened the hood, and sitting on the back of the car in front of her, she began to fiddle with the engine. The smell of gasoline and body hung in the air.
As if plucked from the earth by some unknown power, Dr. Cranes car gave a sputter and rose into the air. She rushed towards the door, pulled herself up, and put her foot on the gas. She looked down, looked at her ticking watch, then looked down again. As her car sped forward, her pursed lips gave the slightest intimation of a smile. 
She reached into the glove compartment and pulled out an ice-cold coca cola. When she raised her bottle in celebration, she heard a clink. 
She woke up, sweaty, and brought her hand back down from where her dream catcher hung, still swinging.
?Craven
When I woke up, I looked out of my bedroom window, ominous clouds hung in the air. The craven finch outside flitted muscidly from tree to tree frightened by the inclement whether. The finchs usually adroit wings retrogressed into a negligible excuse for wings because the wind was so frigid. He could no longer fly
 With a cursory glance at my alarm clock that had been harassing me for the past fifteen minutes, I jump out of bed, got dressed, and ran outside. In no time at all, I too found myself craven and terrified.

The Use of Imagery to Show Authorial Intent in Short Stories
A short story contains a narrative from a period in time. However the focus of the short story does not focus upon this narrative. Instead, the focus is on an authors message to the reader. The authors message--what the author wants the reader to think--is called tone. This tone, often referred to as a moral of the story, is rarely stated outright, but rather is hinted at throughout the story. The process of providing hints to the reader in order for him or her to understand and unravel the authors message is called showing. To cement this idea of showing, we can compare two hypothetical concrete examples. First, in story A, A man is angry. Second, in story B, A man slammed his fist on a table, it lurched upward and came crashing down, while breaking all four of its legs in the process. One can interpret that the man in both stories is angry, but that was only stated in story A. Meanwhile, in story B, a certain tool was utilized in order to show the reader what the author is trying to say. This tool is imagery. Drawing the aforementioned example, imagery is what the reader can see, hear, feel, smell, or taste in the story. The reader can see the closed fist of the man, and hear the smashing of the table. While connected, these data paint a picture of the authors message from story A, A man is angry. In order to better understand the usages and possibilities of the tool of showing, we will take a look at several examples from published short stories.
First of all, Jack Londons, To Build a Fire, is about a man who needs to escape a snowstorm, with his life at stake. London describes the man traversing through the snow as, [The man] ploughed and floundered through the snow. We can see imagery from this sentence in a few ways. First of all, the action of ploughing through a lot of snow is difficult. The reader feels the weight of the snow through the slow ploughing action. Second, the verb floundered, derives its meaning from the flounder fish, a fish that flops around aimlessly and frantically. These two verbs, of futile snow ploughing and tireless floundering paint the picture of a man struggling to get through snow. So, from this imagery, the author is showing the reader that the man is desperately struggling to get through the snow.
Second, In Ambrose Bierces, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, a man is hanged. Bierce provides imagery of the mans watch, more specifically, the sound produced by the watch. Bierce writes, Striking [...] was a sound [...], a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; [...] Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. [...] What he heard was the ticking of his watch. (Bierce). From this quote, we can detect imagery in the form of sounds and metaphors. In terms of sound, prior to Bierce stating that the mans watch is producing the noise, the reader gets to hear a regular metal pinging noise. These descriptions of sound can hint at the fact that the noise is produced by a watch. However, oftentimes, sound alone is not enough to paint a full picture of the authors intent for the reader. This is why Bierce uses metaphors in addition to sounds. The two images that are put in the readers mind are an anvil and a death knell--this specific metaphor is key because a death knell is a type of bell rung at funerals. Given that funerals are about someone dying, a connection is now made between the ticking of the mans watch and his own mortal fate. So, with the ferocious sound of the anvil and the solemn chime of the death knell, in addition to the aforementioned sounds of a watch, the author is showing the reader that the mans time is drawing closer, that his death knells will soon ring, and that he is going to die.
	Third and finally, in An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, The man dreams that he escapes his hanging and swims away in the river below him. The man pays attention to every detail that he can see of the multifarious living, moving, and breathing creatures that exist around him. Bierce says, [The man] [...] saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf. [...] [He] noted the prismatic colors in all the stream, the beating of the dragon flies wings, the strokes of the water spiders legs. (Bierce). There are many examples of visual imagery in this passage, and all of this imagery is a metaphor for being alive. The author reveals this metaphor to the reader through the verb choice of the insects actions and the descriptions of the plant-life. Appearing first, is the veining of [leaves]. Veins are conduits of blood, which is needed to live. Next, Bierce refers to the prismatic colors of the water stream. These same glistening colors are seen in blood, which is needed to live. In terms of the actions of the insects, the Bierce describes the dragon flies wings as beating, just like a heart. Additionally, the Bierce describes the spiders legs as stroking. This resembles the stroking of an engine, which is needed to operate machines. The function of an engine in a machine is similar to that of a heart in a lifeform. The reason for describing such imagery of life, is to trick the reader into thinking the man is still alive. Ultimately, we know that this is not the situation. The man did, in fact, die when he was hanged. However, the reader is shown this imagery before they can come to the conclusion. Bierce wants the reader to believe that the man escaped with his life, and so he includes the exaggerated imagery of life to persuade the reader into mistakenly believing that the man is alive.
Why would one bother with showing as opposed to just telling? Showing can be more effective at engaging the reader than telling. This is because the reader must interpret what they are being shown in order to find out the meaning behind it; this is as opposed to telling, where the author has done the interpretation for the reader. To extrapolate from this, if the reader has to engage more with the story--and continues to do so without setting it down, it is reasonable to assume that they would likely enjoy it more. However, one pitfall of showing is that there is a potential for a discrepancy to form between what the author intends and the reader actually interprets. When an author provides certain imagery, they are thinking about that imagery from their own perspective. So, for example, if an author likes grapes and uses them as a metaphor for tastiness, but the reader hates grapes, they will make a connection to the metaphor opposite to the authors--Although, a good author will likely be conscious of this fact. For this reason, in some cases, telling the reader something can be a necessity. Telling might be necessary if a characters actions could have multiple meanings. Then, some context might be needed in order for a reader to understand the authors intended meaning behind the action However, in most cases, showing in a story both captivates the reader and supports the authors idea of the story. And, the tool of showing is a useful artifice for doing so.?Con:

?	Starting around ten thousand years ago, humans began a part of their evolutionary journey that would change them as a species forever. They began the gradual process of settling down and becoming farmers. The first human farmers farmed wheat. Becoming farmers gave humans many advantages, one of which was increased population size. However, farming life was difficult and had many pitfalls. An increased population size meant a greater need for land, both to house new people as well as plant food to feed them. The humans that survive off of a single source are very vulnerable to famine if the source fails to produce the necessary quantities. And unlike farmers, foragers were very mobile and did not need to own land as a base. A need for land and insurance of crop success is what caused farmers to be more violent than foragers.
	The human population expanded in size after the agricultural revolution, so there was a need for more land for more food and more housing. Farmers needed land for two main reasons, housing and food. Farmers stayed year-round in settlements, so those who lived there would need land to live upon. (Harari 85). Additionally, wheat takes a large area of land to grow. With more people in a farming settlement, more land for food is needed. Then, humans would compete and battle over land. With more land taken, a farming groups territory would expand. Human bands who first developed farming of wheat in small regions of Jericho where would could grow would inevitably cross in farming land, their would need to determine ownership, often times in violent ways. (Harari 86).These traits were unlike those of the nomadic forager, who would live without ownership of land nor in close enough proximity to fellow foragers to fight. Foragers today live mainly in isolated and inhospitable areas such as the Arctic or the Kalahari, where population density is very low and opportunities to fight other people are limited. (Harari 59). Additionally, due to their mobility, foragers didnt settle any land permanently and would therefore not need to protect it. Foragers moved house every month, every week, and sometimes even every day. (Harari 43).
	Human farmers survived based off of a single large resource: wheat. Crops were valued and needed to be protected from both weather and other people in order to survive. In terms of weather and drought, Harari writes, By increasing their dependence on a single source of food, they were actually exposing themselves even more to depredations of drought. (Harari 87). Farmers were very protective of their wheat, they needed to protect their sole source of food. As aforementioned, the human population was expanding and so competition over land increased. If a certain farming group was in danger of not being able to supply themselves with food, they would need to take another groups food. In turn, this lead to violent competition over a single source of food. In contrast, human foragers were mobile and relied on many sources of food. If one source of food was depleted, they could make due with the others. (Harari 49). Competition between a single food source was unnecessary for foragers as they relied on many sources of food.
	Additionally, the psychological aspect of a worse life and living conditions caused violence to increase among farmers. [Humans exchanged] a rather good life [of foraging] for a more miserable existence [of farming] (Harari 81). Because of the miserable life of farmers, they would be more motivated to change their lives through violence or other means than foragers who lived rather good lives.
	Farmers were more violent than foragers because of their need for land and food.

Incorporate the following words into your paragraph:
intimation, stolid, adulterate, adroit, retrogress, impetus
As Ive read the short stories from Into the Widening World, one of the key concepts present was to give an intimation of the characters thoughts and feelings rather than state them. This is called Show Dont Tell. For this to come across in the right way, you have to be an adroit storyteller, because if you have little experience with this concept, your writing may be adulterated by high-flown language and ideas. If you try too hard, it's like your writing skill has retrogressed back to an elementary school level. This leads to confusion. While show dont tell might seem as though the characters are stolid and boring, when used well, and investigated by the reader, it can be the impetus for an exhilarating story.?You will be given this prompt in class.

Suicide/NSSI & Self Preservation Instincts.

https://public.wsu.edu/~taflinge/biology.html
There are two elements involving suicide that will be discussed: the difference between NSSI and suicide, and suicide from an evolutionary perspective in conflict with the natural instinct--that surpasses just the realm of Homo sapiens--of self-preservation.
To begin with, the former will be addressed, specifically in regards to suicide versus non-suicidal self injury. Both conditions, suicidal thoughts or actions, and non-suicidal self injury stem from common stressful factors. Some factors include but are not limited to: trauma, feelings of isolation, substance abuse, depression, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness. (Cornell Universitys Research Program on Self-Injury and Recovery, The relationship between non-suicidal self-injury and suicide). Additionally, it is noted that participation in NSSI is also a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, despite the similar causes, suicide and NSSI have two different objectives: self-preservation and self-destruction. While both suicide and NSSI result in self-destruction, the result of NSSI is not death. Cornell Universitys Research Program on Self-Injury and Recovery summarizes the difference as follows, Non-suicidal self-injury is typically used as a coping strategy for preserving and enhancing life; not ending ones life. However, since NSSI and suicidality both indicate underlying distress it is important to assess whether self-injurious youth are also suicidal. (Cornell Universitys Research Program on Self-Injury and Recovery, The relationship between non-suicidal self-injury and suicide). The latter assertion made in the quote reiterates the idea that NSSI can lead to suicidal thoughts or actions. So, to summarize, while suicide and NSSI can originate from the same stressors, each is a coping mechanism with a different goal in mind. NSSI, while destructive, aims to change the situation in order to cope, while suicide aims to remove ones self from the situation in order to avoid problems entirely. However, neither method is a healthy solution to the initial stressors. Professional help and therapy is strongly recommended in order to deal with the aforementioned factors and more.
Secondly, the latter topic of suicide from an evolutionary perspective in contrast with the instinct of self-preservation. As mentioned in the introduction, humans, in addition to all life forms, have the natural instinct of self-preservation. (Washington State University, The Biological Basis of Human Behavior, Richard F. Taflinger). However, chiefly, this instinct is in terms of self-preservation of their genetic material and, in turn, their offspring. An example of this, as mentioned in the Scientific American article, Is killing yourself adaptive? That depends: An evolutionary theory about suicide by Jesse Bering, is with cannabalistic spiders and suicidal bees. The male spiders were cannibalized by the females to provide for their offspring, and if certain bees became infected with fly larvae, they would fly away and die to spare the hive from infection. These behaviors represent self-preservation being secondary to either, preservation of offspring, or colony. However, the article does note that there are differences between such evolutionary behaviors in spiders and bees, and humans. However, it does connect such evolutionary behaviors to humans via an article published in 1986 by evolutionary neurobiologist Denys deCatanzaro, titled, mathematical model of self-preservation and self-destruction. Bering summarized the model, People are most likely to commit suicide when their direct reproductive prospects are discouraging and, simultaneously, their continued existence is perceived, whether correctly or incorrectly, as reducing inclusive fitness by interfering with their genetic kins reproduction. In other words, a person is most likely to commit suicide when they are unlikely to have children, and continuing to live will not improve their ability to pass on their genes. From a subjective standpoint, this statement does not seem to distance to logic of suicide from the spiders or bees. However, studies both by deCatanzaro and other researchers have evidenced the model. So, while this answer shys away from addressing the personal stressors of suicide, it might conclude that if the result of any stressors, depression for example, were to not lead to reproduction, the it would be a suicidal-inducing stressor. The key example given in the article was that of homosexual-identifying men and their increased suicide rates in comparison to other groups. However, there are major flaws with the logic of the model. For example, there are those who are happy and non-suicidal that are not capable of reproducing. While numerous studies have been done to provide evidence for the reproduction-necessity model, perhaps there is a different answer.
In conclusion, humans can have different reactions to stresses. Include both non-suicidal self harm, and suicide. Those two methods either change or remove the stressors. In the case of removing stressors by way of suicide, it appears that the likelihood of dying by suicide is factored by ones basic instincts and requirement of genetic self-preservation. The last relationship is that of NSSI on inclusive fitness, the ability to maintain genetic self-preservation.?What is the nature of humanity?

I was considering using images of Maslows hierarchy of needs, but I reread the instructions once more, and you said be clear with your writing. Not use of pictures so I didnt use pictures. If I did, I would use the standard triangular hierarchy and an alternate graph one.

Minimum: 1,000 Words
Maximum: 2,000 Words	Two major changes in humans evolution redefined what it meant to be human. The first of which is the Cognitive revolution. The Cognitive revolution allowed humans to develop traits never before seen in other animals, languages, and religions. Language and religion for the unification of humankind. (Sapiens) These however are not the only defining factors of humanity. In addition to the Cognitive revolution, there was another human revolution called the Agricultural Revolution. This revolution enabled humans to construct cities, laws, and money. (Sapiens) These two revolutions can be summarized as follows, the Cognitive revolution defined humans, and the Agricultural revolution defined society. So, the language-speaking, religious humans make up the city or empire-located, law-based, monetary-trading society. However, due to the creation of societies, from an ethical perspective, both good and bad things have happened to humans by humans. To name a few examples, humans have both invented medicines to cure the sick, and invented weapons to wage war and killed each other. This raises the question: When are humans capable of good, and when are humans bad?
According to Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, humans need to have certain items and relationships with others in order to be fulfilled, or happy. These needs are knowns as Maslows Hierarchy of Needs. So, humans are capable of good only when they have their Maslowian basic and psychological needs are met.
	First, it is paramount to explain Maslows Hierarchy of Needs. Maslows Hierarchy is in the shape of a five-layered triangle with three stages: basic needs; psychological needs; and self-fulfillment needs. The basic needs consist of two layers: the physiological needs of food, water, warmth, and rest; and the safety needs of security and safety. The psychological needs consist of belongingness and love needs, and esteem needs. The first of which is about relationships and friendships, and the second is about feeling prestige and accomplishment. Finally, the last, self-fulfillment layer describes self-actualization or achieving ones potential.
The original version of the model (M.H.o.N. Wikipedia) suggests that a person is in one layer of the hierarchy at a time, while a dynamic version suggests a variance in the intensity of each need as personal development increases. (M.H.o.N. Wikipedia) The needs that are required in order for humans to be capable of good are the physiological needs of food, water, warmth, rest, and safety; and the psychological needs of relationships and accomplishment. Without these, humans cannot be capable of good.
	Next, it is also important to understand what doing good means. There are multiple definitions for doing good. However, the definitions, in essence, mean aiding in the attainment of others needs. An example of this is inventions. For example, the invention of G.M.O.s is controversial, however it can be seen as being good because it helped those who needed the most basic of needs to get food. (https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/01/26/cheap-food-thank-gmos/)
	A simple example of a basic need affecting ones judgment can be seen in an article discussing sentencing from judges based on their hunger. (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lunchtime-leniency/) In this case, the human brain has limited resources, and those resources can be devoted to psychological processes, such as judging when the physiological needs of nutrition are satisfied. Nutrition and the other Maslowian basic needs are key in the Agricultural revolution because it was the first time humans were able to sit down and generate an excess of food. An excess of food meant that humans were able to focus on something other than the gathering of food in order to survive.
The extra time humans had to think allowed them to do good, like invent and innovate. (https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/69/3/180/5320252) However, when humans needed to gather food to survive, they acted in a bad manner such as fighting over food or land. An example of this is with wheat, the first domesticated plant. Wheat was a catalyst for permanent settlements, (Sapiens 86) which are good for society. Yet, at the same time, many wars were fought over wheat and land that could grow it. Another basic need is sleep. It is relevant to note that sleep deprivation can lead to insanity or death. Neither dead nor insane people can think rationally and so sleep is a requirement. To summarize, when humans do not have basic resources, they either cannot devote the time to developing themselves or society for good. Or, they fight over what resources do exist, and that is bad.
However, what allows people who do not have their most basic needs met to do good deeds? There are two answers to this question. The first of which is that the good deeds that the person does will ultimately lead to their attainment of the basic needs. A tangible example of this is hunger-striking. However, one caveat that could be presented in that case is that those who are protesting, in fact, have access to their basic needs but are merely choosing not to use them. In this case, a more extreme example could be slave revolutions. The people who are enslaved are doing a good deed for themselves by freeing themselves of enslavement. While the people who are enslaved likely did not have their basic physiological needs met, they would likely be revolting to support their psychological needs of relationships with their children and their childrens well-being. This example of psychological needs being met while basic needs are not is reminiscent of the dynamic hierarchy model, wherein one can have the psychological need of ensuring their childrens safety, while not having their basic needs of food and proper shelter.
Secondly, psychological needs are also a requirement in order for humans to act in a good way. Once again, the psychological needs are relationships and the feeling of accomplishment, the former being more important. As aforementioned, relationships can be an inspiration for good deeds. Relationships are also built on trust and collaboration. Collaboration is a requirement for invention (legally, collaboration is key in obtaining patents) and improvement of society. The importance of relationships can be seen when juxtaposed to the absence of relationships. While it is an unrealistic scenario, if a human with basic needs but no relationships seeks to do good, they will not have a frame of reference as to what would benefit others. This lack of understanding of others inhibits a humans ability to good for others besides themselves. An example of this can be imagined between a human living in a town and a human living on their own. The human in the town is aware of the psychological needs of other humans, so, that human can act on those needs. The secluded human is only aware of themselves. So, while their seclusion in of itself does not inhibit that human from doing good, it reduces their capability to do good.
Overall, a human requires both physical and psychological needs to be capable of doing good. With limited resources, humans can only focus on being good when their basic needs are satisfied. This is the same as the psychological needs. However, the psychological needs provide a reference frame for how to benefit society. Both sets of needs allow for humans to do good, help others achieve their needs. Ultimately, while not the topic of this essay, in Maslows opinion, the ultimate goal of life is to achieve ones full potential.?Luca Millard-Kish

Patria and Religion
He who does not know how to deceive does not know how to rule. (cited in biography.com). These are the words of Rafael Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic. The book In the Time of the Butterflies tells the story of the four Mirabal sisters and their involvement in the movement against Trujillos regime. Patria Mercedes is the oldest of the Mirabal sisters and throughout the book, religion guides her decisions and involvement in the movement. Religion is a belief in something greater, an omnipotent power. Throughout history, it has been a source of inspiration and guidance for many people. Patria Mercedes is no exception. The Patria and the Mirabal sisters fight for their belief in a free government throughout the book, and they inspire others to do the same. Patrias involvement in the movement is influenced by her relationship to religion.
In the beginning, Patria Mercedes is the most religious and docile of the sisters. She believes that love will win out and life will just happen.  The first time we hear from Patria, she says, From the beginning, I felt it, snug inside my heart, the pearl of great price. No one had to tell me to believe in God or to love everything that lives. I did it automatically like a shoot inching its way towards the light (44). This shows Patrias personality in one broad stroke. She loves everything and finds solace in religion and God. In this context, the phrase, Pearl of great price, refers to the love of religion inside of her. While this is her initial view, as she matures and starts to have new feelings and desires, Patrias thoughts begin to change. They lead her to leave the Inmaculada, the religious school that she was previously attending, and stay at home. After she leaves, she meets Pedrito, the love of her life, and she gets pregnant. Alvarez depicts the scene of Patrias miscarriage as a beat in her religious development, and eventually, her involvement in the movement. Alvarez writes, And suddenly, I was crying in her arms, because I could feel the waters breaking, the pearl of great price slipping out, and I realized I was giving birth to something dead I had been carrying inside me (52). The reoccurrence of the phrase, Pearl of great price, referring to her dead child, can be likened to the dead religion that had been living inside of her. At this point, she begins to lose her faith. Saying that she was giving birth to something dead she had been carrying shows that her faith was already faltering, and the event of losing her child was the impetus for her reckoning with her change of view towards religion.
	As her sisters, especially Minerva go headfirst towards the movement, Patria is more cautious. She is grieving her lost child and searching for her new purpose now that she set religion aside. Patria uses the commitment to her family as a new direction for her life, but also a guise that covers up the fact that she is scared to join the movement. With time, Patria says I got braver like a crab going sideways. I inched towards courage the best was I could, helping out with the little things(154). We see Patrias internal struggle to confront her uncertainty and fear around the movement, but it still isnt until later that she fully commits. As the opportunities for Patria to get involved with the movement become more frequent, she begins to hesitate. She considers going back to the safety of religion. My old yearning to be in the religious life stirred. I felt myself rising, light-headed with transcendence, an overflowing fountain. Thank the Lord I had that child in my womb to remind me of the life I had already chosen (160). This illustrates her coping with the fact that her past life has changed, and the role of religion in this new chapter will look different. After Patria experiences a violent shelling and sees a young boy die in front of her eyes, she has a realization. This experience impacts her view towards the movement and muddies her faith yet again.  Coming down that mountain, I was a changed woman (162).
In the last part of the book, Patria sees the movement in a new light. She cant believe God would let so many people suffer. Alongside her sisters, all except Ded, Patria helps to raise awareness and stands a proud mariposa. When her son, Nelson, is taken by the regime she begins to pray to El Jefe. Religion has come back into her life, but she uses it for a different purpose. She says I dont know if thats how it started, but pretty soon, I was praying to him [Trujillo], not because he was worthy or anything like that. I wanted something from him, and prayer was the only way I know to ask (202). In desperation, Patria offers herself as a sacrificial lamb in order to see her son. El Jefe, a hedonistic and vile man, the antithesis of God, wants one thing, and one thing only from women, and in Patrias need, she considers giving him what he wants. During her audience with El Jefe, Patria gets her son back, but she worries that the evil one had become flesh like Jesus. She had offered herself to God, but when the line between God and El Jefe became unclear, Alvarez suggests that Patria sacrificed herself for her son. 
There are different reasons that one might speak up against injustice, but as shown in Patrias involvement in the movement, there was a correlation between when she saw the little boy die on the mountain and the shattering of her faith in humanity. This led her to join the movement because it was an intimate and relatable experience. It couldve been her boy. In the end, Patria dies for what she believes in, but it took many steps, all of which made her question or completely renounce her religion, for her to commit herself to the movement. From these three examples of Patrias relationship to religion, we can start to connect religions influence on Patrias decisions. This raises the question: does Patria use religion as a coping mechanism in the book, and what is it about her experience that leads her to change her views and join the revolution? Religion unites, divides, and heals, and throughout history, it has been the motivation for many displays of social activism. Patria Mercedes Mirabal was a strong woman who used the power of a belief in something greater to raise awareness and fight for what she believed in.

?What do you think that the Renaissance and Reformation teach you about the world, history, ideas, and humanity?
The renaissance, or rebirth as it literally means, was a period in human history in which many individuals expressed themselves in new ways, including but not limited to, art, literature, math, and music.
In general, the renaissance has a few main ideas and focuses. The first focus is on humankind and individualism. The focus on humankind describes the humans capacity to create. The term Man is the measure was used by Protagoras, a greek philosopher--The significance of the time period of the ancient Greeks will be mentioned later. The focus of individualism led to the appreciation of the human form. This caused the art of the time to closely examine the musculature and the minute details of the human anatomy.
The second focus of the renaissance was the return to the old, great, ideas. This is why the man as the measure is focused on, because it came from the classic Greco-Roman ideas. Those ideas were, at the time, over a century old.
The renaissance led into another period of time known as the reformation. The reformation was a period in which Martin Luther presented criticisms--at least 95 of them--about the catholic church. Luthers criticisms of the church can be summarized in three points: the sale of indulgences, money to ensure that you go to heaven regardless of your sins, is bad; the pope has no power over purgatory, a non-physical limbo lobby to wait for heaven; and, connected to the first point, the indulgences distract from an individuals true salvation for heaven. However, Martin Luther was not the first to have these ideas.
There was another man, named NAME, who came before Martin Luther. But, his complaints fell on deaf ears. This was due to the fact that the time period when NAME spoke out was not ready to act on what he had to say. However, the  reformation was the right time for Martin Luther due to one invention: the Gutenberg printing press. The printing press was the first major catalyst of the spread of information. One of the books that the press printed was the Gutenberg Bible. Previously, only wealthy members of society and religious figures could read the bible due to the expense it took to craft them. However, with the rapid export of bibles from the press, now regular folk could gain access to the text of the bible. Luther noted that many of the claims of the church had no evidence in the bible. So, when everyone got ahold of the bible, they could see that Luthers claims were true. The bibles were also later translated into German from Latin so that even those without education in latin could read them.
	
	One question that can be asked from these events is: what was the impetus? In other words, what is the cause of the renaissance and the reformation. Then, how does understanding the cause help to understand the patterns of human cognitive revolutions.
	To begin with, it is important to mention that there is no one sole factor that caused either the renaissance not the reformation. However, to reiterate and add a couple major factors: Martin Luthers ideas being spread via the Gutenberg printing press; the retrogression to the Greco-Roman ideas and humanism caused people to see the value in the individual; and The support from powerful figures such as the Medici family who funded many renaissance art pieces.
These factors can be somewhat over-simplified to easily view a picture of the ingredients for a shift in the zeitgeist of human ideas. One element was the technology. The invention of the printing press allowed for the spread of information. Another example of technology is the computer, and how it contributed to the space race, which was a battle between two global superpowers, which happen to be countries--so you would be right to think the word nationalism--to display dominance.
Another element is the idea itself. Are the changes plausible? One man, who goes by the alias Vermin Supreme, has ran for president in the state of Massachusetts for over thirty years has pitched radical ideas such as a pony identification program in which citizens would need ponies and their DNA as identification. This idea of pony identification isnt feasible and so it wouldn't yield any change in the ideas of voters. Sometimes, the ideas of individuals are good ideas, however, the time period is not right for change to occur. This can be seen in the example of NAME. persons such as this can be thought of as ahead of their time or futurists.
Furthermore, the idea has to be noticed by a person in power, at least before the time of the internet. This is because the power of an individual changes based on time period. So, during the 1600s, it would have been necessary to have power figures either support or notice a change. Otherwise the idea of change could not be spread. The only other option would be to revolt against those in power. However, that takes a great deal of organization and a clear goal.
Finally, on a more abstract level that is not just relevant to human cognitive revolutions, ?The Nurses Lament
The hours of the night are growing short,
And yet she asks of me the news of love,
That Romeo in her mind makes consort,
But she hath only chattered from above.
With him her mood an ardent river flow,
Yet talk of marriage could be jeopardy,
The fate of Job neer wanes his love, oh no,
Such quick conclusions lead to locks, not keys.
I nursed a girl, not woman, mercy me,
Oh, when and how did she become a dame?
Those girls who grow too fast no good will be,
Her foolish fancies lead her to the same.
And then again, when two fit like a glove,
I must extol the ways of budding love.

Hope
Echo! She called. Echo, echo, echo Silence swept over the emptiness like waves in the middle of the ocean.
Okay, so we can turn around now? The boy asked. He reached for his feet. He felt his legs, arms, hands. He checked his head. Im going to snap the torch, He said. He closed his eyes. 
Not yet. She whispered. We only have one.
It will last long enough, right? He took a deep breath and his hair stood on end. Her fading voice called, Echo!
Come here, come here! He shouted. She rolled her eyes in the dark, Where?
Follow my voice, he said twice. She crawled toward him, sliding her hands on the ground. Preoccupied with getting to him, she planted her hands and feet onto the cold ground. Then, one hand slipped and touched nothing, and the rest of her followed into the emptiness. The darkness consumed the sound of her crash. Keep following my voice, he continued. Hello? His hands shook. He decided to go to her instead.
She blinked her. She groaned and grabbed her arm. She planted her feet and arms on firm ground. As she stood up, she probed above her head. She held her shoulder and rotated her arm around, wincing in pain. She tenderly touched her elbow and then brought her fingers to her mouth, blood. She shivered, plodded forward, and stumbled. She rolled from her knees to the ground. She curled up and closed her eyes again. Then, snapped open her eyes. She could see a steady warm orange glow illuminating the top of the rocks. She shuffled herself to a standing position and looked up. Stupid! She called up to the light. Thatll last us another ten minutes, tops.
Hello! He called again. His chest was pounding up and down.
You can stop whining now, Im coming. She responded, Just keep your torch over me. He furrowed his eyebrows and moved his had toward the unlit flare in his pocket. She looked up, but the light evaporated.
Take my hand, he said. He reached out and grabbed a skinny cold limb. He sniffed and scrunched his nose, I think you fell in something. He hoisted the arm toward him, falling backward. Then, an eerie green light flickered on and revealed a tall crooked figure. The green light was protruding from its head like the lure of an anglerfish. The boy laid frozen in place. He released his grip on the alien arm. His hands shook again. The green light flickered and produced a scratch, and the creature was gone.
	Im waiting, she called. He scampered to go help. This time, he felt her warm, human arm, and gripped it with all his might.
	I He began but was cut off by a screeching, ear-splitting scream that shot off the walls of the cave. Can you The noise attacked again. Hear too? He asked with his voice shaking. There was no response.
The air cooled and condensed around her. She turned around and squinted her eyes. The rocks scraped and she slipped. A cold wind whistled above her head. She stared down at the ground, and a green light produced a flickering shadow of her head. She rolled over with her back to the ground to see a tall figure standing above her. The light flickered off. The green light turned back on and she stared straight into the creatures nebulous eyes. She screamed, the noise echoed off the walls, filling the darkness.
He covered his ears as a shriek crashed across the walls, ceilings, and floors. Hope, he cried. She heard the boys voice, calling her name.
Im right here. She said. But the boy shook his head. The green glow illuminated the tears on his face.
Good morning! Said a voice with a green headlamp. You should be more careful next time. The green light was drowned out by the crisp morning sunlight. The boy was lifted and set on the fresh grass. He looked up at the bright yellow sun, and it heated his face. Now this is very important, the boy was told, Was there anyone else with you?
No. All I had was this flare. He reached into his pocket, but there was no flare.?A door opens, and Inerae blinks back their tears. They walk forward, their body trembling as they put on the plain white ceremonial gown that glimmers with a papery sheen. The fine fabric feels vast, cold and hollow. They descend into the courtyard below. Their eyes drift over the other students, most of whom are crying as well, there is a girl dressed in a coppery shawl comforting a weeping girl in a sky blue dress. There is a boy wearing an impeccable black robe maintaining a grim smile, his eyes devoid of compassion, and many more strange students. The girl in copper glances toward Inerae, her brow furrowed.
Youre shaking, are you alright Inerae? 
Inerae looks down. You know whats wrong, why dont you pester someone else they spit out.
We all went through this, you should talk about it with your friends the girl offers.
My only friends are the Spirits, and the only way to reach them is to repeat the ceremony. With that, Inerae turns from the courtyard.  
	A door opens, and Inerae walks from the school, their body numb. they drift along the hard packed roadways in silence, cold on their bare feet, until they reach a temple of stone and wood that gazes downwards with the force of judgement. A chill wracks Ineraes slender form as they enter the building that only ereyesterday had thrummed with a mute choir of unmistakable majesty, lending the stones the warmth and love of life. Inerae steps up to the altar, faltering as the imagery on the walls crowds around them, the paintings of animals, the incense, the sacrificial knife on the altar. The symbology is contradictory, somehow. A folded piece of paper on the altar drags Inerae from their contemplative stupor, the list of evening prayers. They would have to lead the service later this evening, as traditional for one who has returned from the ceremony. But how could the proper song reach so distant a locale, how could the Voice echo from forever? Inerae collapses to their knees and weeps, for they know that Spirit had abandoned their people long before anyone could ever have imagined.. Inerae rises, glowering at all the carvings and paintings around them. they retrieve the ceremonial knife and ascend, purpose guiding their footfalls, to the carvings of the nine prophets. Inhaling, they let the emptiness collapse upon their knife, which glows and flashes in response to the light. They plunge the blade into the carvings, one by one, letting the fire of rage become the fire of light until they take a stand among the shattered pieces of mistake after mistake after mistake. It takes them far too long to come to the realization that they have been sobbing. The broken head of Malkuth, the ninth prophet, examines them with quiet reproach, and Inerae feels the cold of the temple seething and boiling. Ineraes teeth begin to chatter, as they stagger down to the center of the temple, its almost as if there is a weight atop the world as everything compresses and falls. Soon, there is nothing but cold to illuminate the mind and body.
	A door opens, and Inerae is once again a crumpled piece of paper falling up the streets of the city. Everything seems to rise as if reaching for the light that cannot be found here. There could not be another explanation, not one that they would accept. Today, any direction they walk they descend ever towards their school and its wood bound doors. They press into the university and towards the passageway leading back to the ceremony, just to find that still waiting there is the student with the impeccable black robes and the grim smile. 
You turned back. he says 
As I expected. Those whose eyes cannot see beyond the radiance and whose ears are deafened by paeons of exultation can never resist returning to the wilderness. 
Inerae clenches their teeth and mutters Why didnt you leave, if you are so obsessed with logic and reasoning?
Every action we take contributes more to our story, but who is there to read it when you are dead and gone? I will be waiting by the doorway, transcribing your soul within a black bound tome. I look forward to reaping the fruits of your nescience. The boy says. Then he grins with an awful finality. There is no lock that blocks your path, Inerae''. Inerae glares at him, exhales, and turns towards the doorway, beginning a long chant. The boy walks over to the courtyard, then turns back around to watch. Ineraes chant rises in volume, each word drawn from the memories they had formed over many days of exacting practice and rote repetition. It flows into the door and fades away, and a silence permeates the room for a brief spell of time. Inerae looks up at the door, quite simple for so important a passageway, and acknowledges with care that it is almost certain that they will never return to this space. The boys calm voice repeats itself at them, as well as the girl with the copper shawls empathetic nagging. Their hand reaches for the door, the boy reaches for his book, the fine paper hungering for ink.
	A door opens, and a light floods the room and causes the ground to tremble, the boy closes his eyes for a moment, Inerae breathes, and everything ends.

Symbolism In Gal Fayes Small Country
A story without symbols is like a winter without snow. A symbol is a concrete thing or action that represents an abstract idea. Stories without them can drag by, just like winters with no sign of snowfall, but a story with symbols hold the excitement of a snowflake; each one is unique and completely different. Symbols work by figuratively tying the physical characteristics of an object, the size, smell, or texture, to a window across an alleyway by a clothesline, and fastening the other side to an abstract idea, the hanging flower bed across the alley, twenty feet up and fifteen feet over, to create a place on which to hang your story. There are different kinds of symbols; both conventional and personal. A conventional symbol, like a dove, a cracked mirror, or an apple, can easily be recognized by the reader, and its significance to the story can be shallow. A personal symbol holds importance to the author, and might not be immediately noticed by the reader, but that doesnt mean its not there. With personal symbols, their multi referentiality requires the reader to pursue knowledge outside of the story for the symbol to come across in all the ways the author intended. When trying to recognize a symbol, you have to follow your gut instinct. Then, try to find ideas and quotes to support your claim. If the characteristics of the object are also shared with an emotional state, a mental state, or any other abstract concept, you can assume that the author placed it there on purpose as a symbol. Symbols help to tell a story by letting your reader interpret scenes in different ways based on how much prior knowledge they have about the symbol. A story that uses symbols very effectively is Small Country, by Gal Faye, an example of a coming-of-age journey that works with symbolism to highlight important scenes. In Small Country, Gal Fayes adroit use of symbolism helps to show Gabriels, the main characters, developing sense of identity during mental, physical, political, or emotional shifts.
As Gabriels reality shifts around him, one thing stays the same. He lives on a street in Bujumbura, Burundi, but its not just a regular street; he lives on a cul-de-sac. When you enter the cul-de-sac, the first impression is of a community. Everyone lives in close proximity, and theres a sense of comfort. The impasse - the cul-de-sac where all five of us lived - was the zone we knew best. (55)  Despite being content with the comfort of his street and home, Gabriels mother, Maman, and his father, Papa, start to have trouble with their relationship, and eventually, they split up. This creates a chasm in Gabriels identity because his family was the glue that held everything together for so long.  As tension grows, Gabriel wants to hide from the horrors of genocide and the crack in his family and hopes his country will heal and his family will go back to how it was. This yearning sense of nostalgia is buried deep in Gabriels heart throughout the book. Although he always wants things to go back to how they were, another, ever-changing, aspect of Gabriels identity is his gang; five boys who live in his cul-de-sac and are like a family to him once Maman and Papa split. We knew all the hiding places in our cul-de-sac, and we wanted to stay there for the rest of our lives, all five of us, together. (63) This quote shows that Gabriel was content with his life. Later in the book, once he starts to read books, and his view of the world broadens, the dead-end street, the cul-de-sac, where he lives starts to make him feel trapped. For the first time in my life I felt suffocated by our dead-end street, where my worries went round in circles. (140) Gabriels worries about his family, friends, and country cant escape from his dead-end street. But one thing unlocks the world to him. It opens once hes introduced to the endless source of knowledge that comes from books and his view of the world is amended. From Gabriels mental shift throughout the book and the fact that Gal Faye writes that Gabriel lives in a cul-de-sac, we can conclude that the cul-de-sac is meant to symbolize both the physical and mental confines of Gabriels world. What this example shows in relationship to the story is that to convey an idea where words fall short, Gal Faye uses symbolism, a picture, to make Gabriels transformation come to life. What this shows in the context of the real world is that there is always more to learn if you keep striving.
Throughout the book, both Gabriels physical and political identity shift. An example of this is when Maman travels to Rwanda during the genocide. When she returns, shes emaciated and completely transformed. The effects of war broke her, and she says, referring to the house she saw, But in the house there were still those four stains of the floor. Huge stains where they had lain for three months. I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed with water and a sponge. But the stains wouldnt go. (156) In the context of war, this symbol of a permanent stain shows the lasting impact of violence and hatred. In another scene, Gabriel is faced with the choice either to kill or not to kill. If he doesnt throw the Zippo lighter into the car with a person in it, his family is in danger, but if he does, his identity is. In the end, he decides that the innocence and safety of his family are of greater importance, and Faye writes, I tossed the Zippo lighter and the car caught fire. (172) This indelible act of violence contradicts his growing sense of agency, but more importantly, it shows that his identity has become strong enough to withstand the blow to his morals when his family is on the line. The Zippo lighter is used to symbolize the mindless killing of people, and the distance from which one can kill, making it a venial offense rather than a crime. From these two examples, we can conclude Gal Faye uses symbolism to show the physical and political shift in Gabriels identity as he starts to find his own voice.
	Gabriels identity changes over the course of the book, but the weight of different symbols do too. The juxtaposition between the two major incidents in the book involving water is alarming, but nothing is hidden from the reader about the incidents significance to Gabriels development, they just need to look back at the two occurrences more carefully. It then becomes apparent that water is used to symbolize clarification, cleansing, or even a baptism. Francis, Gabriels adversary, invites himself to Gabriels eleventh birthday party and gets in a terrible fight with him and his friends. By the river, Francis attempts to drown Gabriel and his best friend Gino with animosity. A hand dragged us over to the rivers edge and Francis plunged our heads in the brown silty waters. (102) The water was dirty and polluted, adulterated by waste and runoff. Gabriel was forced into it. This dirty water is a symbol. Later in the book, once Francis becomes part of Gabriels friend group, they all go to a swimming pool during the turmoil. Gabriel goes over to the high-dive, determined not to look craven in front of Francis and Gino, and begins to climb the ladder. From the top of the diving area, I could see Bujumbura, the vast plain and the age-old mountains of Zaire on the other side of the blue expanse that was Lake Tanganyika. I was standing naked above my city and a tropical rain was washing over me, thick as curtains, caressing my skin. (128) Gabriel willingly jumps. What this shows is that it just took time for Gabriel to accept his cleansing, and when the time was right, Gal Faye uses the symbol of clean water to reinforce the emotional shift that Gabriel undergoes.
My father told me that on the day men stop waging war on one another, it will snow over the tropics. (161) Just as the hot skies of Bujumbura would struggle to produce snow, Gabriel struggles to find his sense of identity over the course of the book. First, his family breaks apart. Then, his friend group crumbles because the pressures of the genocide create a chasm between those who want to fight and those who dont.  Gaby, this is war, said Gino, sounding exasperated. Were protecting our street, because if we dont, theyll kill us. When are you going to understand? What world are you living in? [Gaby] Were just a bunch of kids. Nobodys asking us to fight, or steal, or have enemies.  (153) From this excerpt of a truculent fight between best friends, you can see the divide of a controversial issue. And as if his parents divorce and the loss of his best friend werent enough, finally, his war-torn country collapses. In the end, Gabriel discovers that he has to find an identity outside of other people, and only then will he feel a sense of completeness and agency over his own life. In a letter at the end of the book, he writes, Its been snowing for days and nights over Bujumbura. (174) Although the world may never be at peace as his father said, the turbulence of Gabriels internal war has ended. He found an identity in himself. Gal Faye uses snow to symbolize a blanket that covers up Gabriels suffering. This is the most poignant, moving symbol in the entire book. From all of the previous arguments and examples, especially this one, two things can be concluded about how to effectively use symbols to tell stories. First, use them judiciously. If a story is full of symbols, they start to lose their impact, and the reader becomes bored by the monotony. Second, use a variety of symbols. Some symbols can be cliche and overused, or shallow, so think of symbols that give the story a clothesline, strung across an alleyway, to hold the story up rather than let it fall fifteen feet. A symbol with a limpid and easily accessible connection to the story holds far less gravity than a multifaceted symbol that requires the reader to think in authentic and original ways to recognize the relationship. With a less conventional symbol, the reward the reader gets upon discovering its meaning allows them to receive an understanding of the story that they didnt see the first time. Gal Faye uses these two techniques for symbol use very effectively to show shifts in Gabriels developing identity in the book Small Country.
?It was a quintessentially dark and stormy night. It seemed as if the clouds were grimacing at the poor craftsman who was meticulously scrutinizing over a wooden doll with his well practiced and adroit fingers. The craftsman, being the benevolent citizen that he was, had plans of giving the wooden doll to the little child next door. While the townsfolk might not have thought it feasible, the craftsmans insidious plan had the slightest intimation of duplicity. When the wooden doll was complete, the craftsman went next door to give it to the child. The child, all of two years old, adulterated with greed, gave it only a cursory inspection before forcefully taking the doll. Not much more has to be said about the on goings of that night, except that after playing with the doll, the child became unkempt and dangerous; some might even go as far as muscid. That night, the holocaust that followed left the childs house smoldering.  
The child, however, although she had put the townsfolk in jeopardy, was impervious to the damage she had caused that night. The Craftsman extolled the young girl profusely, but the child retrogressed back to normality with time. The effects of the wooden doll began to wear off. Unsatisfied, the craftsman was averse to the idea that his duplicitous scheme hadnt acted as an impetus to further the childs muscid tendencies. That night, while he washed his face in tepid water, he had a terrible, yet amicable idea...
?On the Basis of Trust
Lets start with the creation of humans beings. A human soul is founded on collective love, trust, and agreement. Through the process of reproduction, two humans have an immense capacity for good. Think about that for a second There is such a strong connection and goodness within two hearts at the same time, that they can will another life into existence. Humans, from the minute they are conceived of, have the capacity for good. We see this in the love of a mother and father to their child and from a sibling to another sibling, from a friend to a friend and from those who have been challenged yet have still come together on a basis of trust.
The capability of trust defines humans as good. Humanity, defined by the collection of a group of individual humans, has a great capacity for good in the world. Their innate connection to one another through relationships highlights the many ways they portray these beneficial traits. A striking example of trust and cooperation between humans is the feat of sending the first person into outer space. The engineer needed to trust the mathemetician, the mathemetician needed to trust themselves, the astronaut needed to trust the whole operation and believe that in the event of an emergency, everyone would come together, no matter their backgrounds, politics, or culture, and help bring them back to earth safely. Love, trust, and connection are contagious, and upon the reentry, of the first people in space, back into the atmosphere, the whole world celebrated in unified trust and cooperation.
Yet another example of this incredible connection and trust of humanity is the awareness about the environment. Things are going in dangerous directions with the climate, and people have come together in the joint belief and hope for something that matters to them. This is our only planet as far as we know, and we might as well take care of it. The band of scientists, researchers, activists, and environmentalists that have swung whole-heartedly towards this crisis are an example of the shared love and goodness of humanity. Peoples collective love of animals and the environment is inspiring to say the least. The public involvement and action continues to highlight the potential for society. 
These two examples of limitless hope and trust are inspiring, but, there is no light without the dark. The dark in this situation comes in the disguise of fear. Fear stirs up trust, love, and connection into the pot of society and burns it because the flame is too hot. Fear comes from a feeling of threatened safety. This comes from the pressures of a racist, xenophobic, and homophobic society. No one should feel the need to be afraid. Therefore, no one should have to endure the burden of anger, hate, jealousy, and discontent. The lack of trust leads to fear which fuels a nation, that stands proud and free, with equality for everyone, to prejudge people who are different than themselves. What other excuse is there for violence and discrimination other than the fact that in the minds of people, there is a difference between people? Because of this difference, people fracture into an us versus them argument that incites fear from a lack of trust.
Paulo Coelho said, None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have Faith. Because none of us know what might happen and because we are all in this together, our capacity for trust moves us forward as a united population. We have faith in each other to be trustworthy and good from the minute were born and then grow up to pass the torch of trust to our children. If we continuously fuel this flame of love and trust than humanity remains good.
Those who grow up and are raised with a lack of trust and love in their family environment tend to pass along that insecurity through their own parenting because they never got the love they needed. While this is a devastating truth about humanity, the stronger and more poignant integrity of humanity is the capacity for love and trust even in the face of such hate and neglect. This, above all, defines humanity as good. Their strength and union, understanding of themselves and others, has and will bring the world together. According to Etimonline.com, the word trust comes  from Old Norse treysta to trust, rely on, make strong and safe. By looking at the root of a word, many different facets become visible. This idea of reliance and cooperation that came from the Norse people still rings true in society today. By making someone feel strong and safe, you pass along the beauty of humanitys potential within your actions. For humanity to be viewed as good, it is crucial for people to make a point of working to trust and value each other. Through united trust, humanity can be good.
Lets end at the rightful place to end, the passing of those we love. Someone who has been loved and has loved passes in the presence of a family that they have curated over many years; a family of unconditional love and trust. Although there is potential for distrust in humanity, trust and love come first and last. From the minute a soul enters the world, they are expecting love and trust in return for their own. Not all young children receive the care they so require, but that is not because people are bad, thats merely because this tragic truth was the same for a mother or father. If everyone feels safe and unthreatened, this feeling gets passed along down generation and through the ages. The initial capacity and yearning for love and trust means that humanity is good from the very beginning, and no matter what makes waves in their safety, which is bound to happen, it can be stripped down to a truly good human. Referring back to humanity as a group of individuals, it becomes clear that if each human has capacity for good, from their first breath, then all of humanity is inherently good.?Luca Millard-Kish

The Sign
Just close the door. 
He spat on the trophy and rubbed the glass with his teeshirt. 
Silent, she hoisted the shopping bags and reached for the door handle. 	
What the hell, its freakin cold in here. Set the bags down and close the Goddamn door! he said from the couch. He took a swig from the bottle sitting on the end table.
	The bags slipped from her hands. Two eggs cracked. She fumbled to wipe up the mess.
	The door is still wide open. What, are you deaf? he slammed the bottle onto the table and rubbed, brow furrowed, the spot where his name was engraved. There was dust in the crevices that got packed down as he rubbed.
	Im sorry, I just I mean well, I just cant reach the handle, and the wind is  she sobbed.
	She fell over sobbing. After taking a shaky breath, she pulled herself back up and looked straight at him, searching. From inside the house, she turned and looked through the doorway in desperation. She could make out the bright yellow sign with the arrow on it. A stream of drool slid down his chin and his eyes glazed over and he surrendered.
---------------
Hey, hows it goin? she asked.
He was waiting at a booth just smiling at her. The chimes rang as the heavy wooden door closed behind her with a thud. She struggled to take off her coat, so he stood to help her.
 Its going pretty well. he shrugged. She saw his bottom lip quiver and he looked as if he was four years old. She saw him paste on a smile within seconds.
Well, how did the race go? she asked.
I didnt win, but I mean, I guess it was fine, he replied.
---------------
	Screams came from the bathroom. 
	Help me! she cried, gasping for breath.
	He was in his room, searching for his old skis under his bed. The front door was bolted shut.
	Im coming, ok? Will you just give me a minute?! he yelled from the other room.
	She sat there. Cold sweat soaked her tee-shirt, her stomach cramped, and blood pooled around her. 
---------------
The sun tried to shine through the clouds, and both of their families were there. The aroma of freshly mown grass filled the air. She wore her light green dress like a costume. His suit hung on him like a uniform, still creased, the tip of the rental receipt just visible from his pocket.
Do you, for better or worse, richer or poorer, and in sickness and in health, take him, as your lawfully wedded husband?
I I do
---------------
	Do I? Do I, huh? Do I have to ask you again? I told you to close the door. Are you worthless? He accented the last word, and it cut in deep.
	You know what, she managed to spit out, I walked six miles to the store by myself to get the groceries, and when I come back, you wont even come and help me? The wind hadnt stopped. The rain hadnt ceased. But, the door was still wide open. She looked at him, and her expression changed. The photograph of him skiing down a hill through racing flags stood on the shelf. Through the storm, she could make out the bright yellow sign with the arrow on it. A tear slid down her cheek and the salty-sweet liquid pooled on the side of her mouth. 
She stepped back. From the outside of the house, she could reach the door handle. She grabbed it and swung the door closed. Through the storm, she could just make out the bright yellow sign with an arrow facing away from town.   
?Mutation and Evolution of Viruses
During this stressful time in the world right now, it is easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of information coming our way. There is so much contradictory information on the internet and its hard to know who to trust. Fortunately, there have been countless other pandemics in history from which we can learn. We are actually very lucky to be in this pandemic with all of the knowledge we have about viruses. In order to clear up some of the confusion on how a virus spreads, and what is needed to stop it, we have to understand the basics of mutations and virus evolution. 
	One of the most important questions is about how a virus spreads. Just as human cells have genetic material in the form of DNA, Covid-19 has RNA. In fact, there are about 30,000 letters (A, U, G, C) in RNA, which translate into various kinds of proteins. Amino acids are encoded by 3 letters of RNA, and proteins are formed from long chains of amino acids. The RNA gets copied in order to spread the virus throughout the hosts body. In this process it is highly likely that a typo or mutation will occur somewhere in the RNA. Most of the time they are harmless, and dont change the overall shape and function of the protein. This is called a silent mutation and it happens when the change in the letter results in the same amino acid. For example, both acu and acg result in the same amino acid (Threonine). On the other hand, there are non-silent mutations which code a different amino acid, though it does not usually result in a drastic change in the function of the protein. Though mutations are mostly negligible, they are imperative for tracking how a virus spreads.
	In the process of copying RNA, it is safe to assume that there will only be a few mutations which wont affect the virus as a whole. Overtime, more and more mutations will accumulate in the RNA, and the more time passes, the more it will differ from the original RNA. In fact, for each virus there is a calculated mutation rate for the average number of mutations over time. This means that the genetic makeup of the virus can give information on how much time passed since the original virus was found. By looking at the specific mutations in the RNA we can also trace the persons infection to its source by comparing it to the RNA of other infected people. Since the mutations of the infected persons virus build off of the already mutated virus of the source, we can track which people got infected from who. This is why it is especially important to test as early as possible in order to successfully track the mutating virus. Mutations can also show which parts of the virus genome are more flexible to mutations. Parts of the genome with many mutations can handle those mutations without causing harm to the virus. On the contrary, less mutations means that those parts are more likely to destroy the virus if mutated. 
	While observing data on Covid-19, along with the constant news coverage on overcrowded hospitals it is easy to assume that the virus is one of the deadliest viruses out there. This could not be further from the truth, in fact the reason why the virus has spread so rapidly is due to the fact that it isnt very deadly. From the perspective of the virus, its main goal is to keep the viral lineage for as long as possible, not to kill as many people as possible. Once someone has developed symptoms from the virus, it is no longer a hospitable place for the virus to live. Yes, the virus can still develop and eventually kill the host but it wont continue the lineage after the host has died; it would need to find a new host. So, it makes more sense for the virus to be highly transmittable, thus keeping the viral lineage. It is also an advantage for the virus to produce mild symptoms, making it more likely for the host to keep in close proximity with other people. This is yet another reason why social distancing is so crucial to help lower the rate of infections from Covid-19. 
	It is important to trust what researchers and scientists say about the pandemic, but what is helpful is knowing the reasons behind what they say. Even just understanding the basics of virus evolution and mutations is enough to see why the government is ordering social distancing and giving widespread testing. Science can also help disprove the common misconceptions about the virus, and relieve some anxiety around it. Especially now in this global pandemic, its harder to connect with our friends and family like we used to. Though it seems as if we are all losing our connection to each other, we are all united through our common goal in overcoming the pandemic.

?The maestro sat diligently at the piano. Gray clouds loomed outside and the wind whipped through the frigid air. He had been sitting there for hours, musing the source of creativity and hoping for the spark. He was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he was unaware of the inclement weather outside. 
He sat alone, alienated from the rest of the world, except for the rain that had managed to slip through a crevice in the ceiling and was quietly harassing him as it dripped, in a rhythmic motif, onto his left shoulder. He quietly began humming a melody, negligible at first, but as the rain continued, the dripping became an artifice that gave way to a symphony. Exhilarated by his discovery, the maestro began to rapidly scribble in his notebook. His consciousness sojourned in a state of unprecedented discovery and exploration. A field that had laid fallow for months now gave way to new inspiration.
?Instructions:
You've learned about some aspects of the War on Terror. You have studied your own war extensively.
Now I want you to write 500 or so words about how you understand the impacting of framing something as a "war on", how you understand each conflict, and what connections you see.
Specific examples are important.
The main goal here is for you to show your ability to talk about framing, connections, and discussing nuance. 
Here is something to consider.
Wars are waged with a goal in mind.
Why are these wars being fought?
Who benefits from having violence or disagreement framed as a war? With the War on Terror, there is now a never ending conflict that justifies the use of executive power. That power will exist as long as the war does.
All of these wars are impossible to end as there is no victory. Consider how your wars can fit into this framework.	First of all, the War on Terror, compared with all of the other wars, is most like a war, given the use of violence and battle. However, the metaphoric use of war fairly represents the conflicts present in each other war on. The term war has several connotations, the first of which is a long-lasting conflict between sides--typically two sides, since humans are excellent crafters of dichotomy, involving multiple battles, with some sort of casualties. Regardless of whether the battles are physical, and the casualties are human lives, the United States has and continues to wage war on both Terror, and Science.
	
To begin with, in terms of the War on Terror, the goal has evolved somewhat over time. Specifically from the United Statess perspective, the first goal after 9/11 was revenge. The narrative was, we were attacked by terrorists, so lets kill terrorists and stop terror. The first message, delivered by President Bush, was more-or-less, Were coming for terrorists, dont stop us. And, initially, most other countries were in support of this goal. Following the United Statess retaliation, the War on Terror became a lot more complicated.
The history within the middle east, such as the Soviet-Afghan war, had formed many different factions and groups. Some groups, such as Al-Qaeda, were ill intentioned and harmful. So, Al-Qaeda was, arguably, a good target for the United States to combat Terror. However, the story is never that clear-cut and simple. The United States wanted to hunt down and seek out terror by finding and dealing with terrorists. The US wanted to stop terror, a noble goal, but their means, such as capturing and torturing innocents in a gray-area-with-the-law zone in hopes that they will one day die and be forgotten, were not universally beneficial.
However, Presidents Bushs word choice of War on Terror, was beneficial toward the United States because it indicated to the American people that the United States will use whatever means necessary, often swift and violent ones--i.e. drone strikes, to kill the terrorists.
At the same time, the usage of the word war could be good for the terrorists. This is because, as a terrorist, ones goal is to cause a lasting impact and memory of terror. Given that the perpetrators of 9/11 have caused a massive shift in one of the most powerful countries in the world, and caused them to go to war on an abstract concept--a war in which they cannot win, the terrorists benefit from a war on terror too.
	
Next, calling the war on science a war makes sense because of what the war on science really is: a repeated attack by lots of entities against the ethos of facts in order to profit.
So, the first question is who are those lots of entities? Two examples of those lots are oil corporations and tobacco companies. The goal of these companies is to make money.The oil companies make money best by sticking with the effective, yet harmful, status quo of burning fossil fuels. Investing in renewable energy is costly, and financially risky, but luckily some companies are learning from the past and investing in it; and entirely new companies are being made that only work with renewable energies.
Big tobacco companies have a slightly different story. The products of tobacco companies are, mostly, addictive and harmful cigarettes. These companies dont really have room to grow in a more beneficial direction, other than to dissolve, I guess. However, the big tobacco companiess goals were to make money. There isnt a single reason for why each of these groups of companies wanted money, but it was certainly their end goal.
And, in their quest for wealth, these companies were willing to sacrifice global health, both in terms of the world and in terms of its inhabitants, in order to meet their goals. In order to meet their goals, the companies had to challenge the legitimacy of the science that said, these companies are hurting global health. Whatever challenges to the actual science, as in respectful and cogent criticisms of scientific methods and practices, were overpowered many-fold by harsh and unjustified criticisms of the credibility, and the origin, of the science that said there was a global crisis.
Like the War on Terror, the companiess original intentions were benevolent, to figure out what problems they were causing. The companies did so in order to, primarily make money, but also to address the possibility that their actions could lead to global harm. However, unlike the war on terror, the actions of the big tobacco and big oil companies devolve into a mostly universal negative: global harm. Where there was nuance in the United Statess actions in the middle east, there was less nuance in the corporationss decisions to use fake scientists and fake studies to lie to everyone saying that their actions were safe and beneficial.
However, luckily for the rest of the world, that is those who opposed the big tobacco and big oil companiess fake science, the framing of war on science suggests that the big companies are in the wrong. Science connotes truth and trust. So, if a company is attacking truth, subliminally, people will get the idea that said company is in the wrong.
Given that these wars are un-ending, so too are they ever-changing. However, even if the wars change, the framing of war on science will always present a narrative of bad companies waging war on the good and truthful science. With the war on science, there is a good and an evil, with, of course, nuance. However, in the war on terror, the sides are not clear-cut. The United States has the goal to remove terror, but in order to achieve that good goal, theyve acted that, not only can be seen as evil, are evil. Such as a drone strike on an aid worker. There will always be complications and nuance within the war on terror, but given that the war on science fits better into a dichotomy, as mentioned earlier, we can better understand this dichotomy of companies and truth.

Prompt: What does it mean to be human?
The genus Homo, which, in English, means man, is the genus that encompases both Homo Sapiens and Homo Neanderthals as well as many others. Although there are many species within the genus Homo, there is only one species that is human, and that is the Homo Sapien. The Homo Sapien has many traits and characteristics that separate it from the other members of its genus. Author Yuval Noah Harari writes about the differences of the Homo Sapiens in his book, Sapiens. The Sapiens were able to rapidly alter their social structures at any point due to a change within the Sapien brain known as the Cognitive Revolution. Sapiens are able to adapt their social structures because of their revolutionary brains. This behavior was never seen from any other species within the genus Homo. These differences between Sapiens and all the other members of their genus are what makes Sapiens uniquely human.
	First of all, Sapiens--who shall be referred to as humans--are capable of creating new social structures and innovations unlike any other member of the Homo genus. Humans control their social structures on the core principle of collective imagination. (Harari 29). Humans believe in a system, such as the law, and abide by it because of their belief in its existence. Harari compares the understanding of primitive societies order being based upon belief in ghosts and spirits to modern institutions which operate on the same basis. (Harari 28). Humans use their imagined reality all the time. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens [humans] have been living in a dual reality. On one hand, the objective reality, [...] and on the other hand, imagined reality. The Cognitive Revolution, which occurred gradually over the course of around 30,000 years ago to 70,000 years ago is what allowed Sapiens, like no other, to produce such a vivid imagined reality. The definitive cause for the cognitive revolution is unknown but, the Cognitive Revolution was most likely caused by accidental genetic mutations which changed the inner wirings of Sapiens brains. (Harari 21). Due to their advanced global imagined reality, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviors within a decade or two. [...] This was the key to Sapienss success. (Harari 34). In contrast, all other species of the genus were unable to adapt at such speeds. The Homo Erectus for example, had the same stone tools for around two million years. (Harari 33).
	Finally, humans were able to manipulate imagined reality quickly among all Sapiens, this allowed for them to quickly change their social structures and interpersonal relations among other core social ideas. The overall theme of rapid change in both cognitive abilities due to the Cognitive Revolution, and the social constructs due to an imagined reality, are what separates Sapiens from all other members of their genus, and what makes them human. 
However, Sapiens may have been the only ones to achieve such advances due to the fact that many of their sibling species were going extinct.
While they may have been the only ones to have done so due to their solitary existence void of any other humanoid species.
?When The Cardinal Sings	
He was ten years old and his grandma said they would be home for dinner. The night wore on as he waited upright in bed, a cello playing in the background trying to tell him something. 
Grandma entered the room with red swollen eyes and said, Oh Kieron, Im so sorry.
All he could do was look at her. The cello became quiet until he could no longer hear it. Silence. She put her hand on his and he could feel her worn soft skin on his fingers before he quickly pulled his hand away and looked at the floor. (I realize that this is backstory, but before I remove it, Id love to talk with you about effective ways of doing that. Thanks!)

He watched as the sun fell below the horizon and birds flew home to their children. He gazed out of the window and one bassoon played a pianissimo and yearning melody. Hed been standing there for thirty minutes at least, just watching the gradual drift of the sky from bright blue to yellow to orange to pink until only see the silhouettes of the trees, bordered by a thin line of golden light, were visible. 
Kieron, where are you? grandma asked in a whisper.
He was distracted by the beauty of the sunset.
The sky was turning completely dark, the most beautiful part, and he didnt want to miss it. A small bird, a flute, flew up and out of a tree and into the darkness and the contrabass and cello held a low sustained note. 
He walked through the hallway into the living room where grandma was sitting. The wooden boards drew him in as he ran his hands over the walls. 
Grandma, the sunset was magnificent this evening, you shouldve seen it! The sky wasGrandma? No, Grandma, no.
He ran outside. The night wasnt as beautiful anymore. Panicked, he ran down the street. In his terror, he kicked over an empty tin bucket carelessly sitting in the pathway. He climbed the stairs to his piano teachers house where he thought he might find help. The paint on the handrails had started to peel, and the flowers she had planted last spring were shriveled and bent, trying to carry life on their shoulders. Half asleep, his teacher opened the door. He tugged on her nightgown but didnt say anything. Confused, she slipped on her shoes and a fur coat and followed him to his house. The strings melody became more agitated while they walked back to his house. The image of his grandma sitting still on the couch flew threw his mind. 
His grandmas funeral was planned to be in two weeks. The townsfolk asked him to write a symphony, as beautiful as symphony no. 2 by Mahler, they teased,  in remembrance and honor of her, and he smiled and said that he would try.

The trees rustled outside, the smoldering fire was struggling to stay ablaze and he just sat there in a daze by the piano. His eyes began to glaze over as he scanned the room for his notebook. He sang melodies, he played them on the piano. He sang other melodies and played those on the piano. He couldnt write them down. The image of his grandma sitting still on the couch flew threw his mind again and a single tear rolled down his cheek. The English horns melody never came.
For days on end, he sat at the piano waiting, hoping to find his manuscript paper in the dim light by the piano. He shuffled over to his money box, and it was empty, the wooden bottom just looked back up at him. One evening while he ambled back to the piano with a tepid cup of rooibos tea, he looked through the frosted window and saw a cardinal perched on a tree branch. The trees were bare but they radiated beauty. The cardinal then rose into the air and flew towards the forest. He stood up and chased after it.
	A gentle dusting of snow lay on the branches, and the moon, just peeking through the clouds, cast a magical light that illuminated the whole forest. He ran further as the cardinal flew. The forest was humming with life. Squirrels darted from tree to tree, heading back homes, and a chipmunk scurried into a bush.
	As he continued after the cardinal, the snowy ground sliced at his bare feet. It felt like hot knives were piercing him with every step, but he kept running. The sky was drifting from bright blue to yellow to orange to pink until he could only see the gnarled trunks of trees on either side of him. The brass section played a fanfare and the tremolo in the string started to get louder. A flute danced above the woodwinds section as the brass died down. With a swell of the cymbals and a slowly climbing melody, a clearing in the forest began to be visible just through the settling fog.
He approached the clearing as the cardinal landed on a birch tree and began to sing; a flute, mellow like the rustling trees. He stopped running and stood still in the clearing. The forest went quiet.
	The moon smiled down on the snowy leaves and illuminated the fog that hung in the air. The audience of trees gently swayed with the music. A pack of wolves gathered around the edge of the clearing, and a cello joined the flute. A fox slinked up to listen to the cardinal and a tenor saxophone started to play. Then a moose, a bear, and a dear; a contrabassoon, the strings, and a clarinet. While the cardinal sang, the forest came to listen. A beautiful cacophony of music soared above the forest and he stood still in the clearing. 

He felt dizzy, almost foggy, as he stood still, looking out the frosted window. His body was radiating and he smiled. He ran to the piano to look for his manuscript paper. He frantically searched the house, looking under the couch, behind the piano, and under his bed. They were still gone. In a trance, he walked outside. In a nearby birch tree, there was a cardinal. Hanging by a string from one of the branches was a small leather notebook and a pen. It was silent and he looked at the cardinal. The cardinal looked back at him. He walked over to the tree, untied the notebook, and walked towards his house, never looking behind him.	
?Write 300-400 words on the following topic. Use Sapiens. Or use any text we have used in class. You can use notes. 
What did studying Rome teach you? What lessons did you learn? Why is it important? Focus on the idea of studying history teaching you something about the present. 
Come up with a thesis. Give examples that prove the thesis. Quotes are good.
Evidence:
?Battle of Cannae ultimate tactic - WWII
?Sic semper tyrannis - (Brutus) Killing kings - Assassination of Lincoln
?Social Wars - Cold War
?What is the goal of writing history?
History is a best-guess narrative of the past. It shows events and societys reactions to them. The story of Rome has many important events that are repeated later in history. Certain events from Roman history are seen as golden standards. Such events are the Battle of Cannae and the Killing of Tyrants. Romans had certain viewpoints and values which were introduced as biases when they wrote their history. Those significant events are always repeated with the intent to show the original societys values.
The Battle of Cannae occurred when Hannibal, a general who the Romans described as being the quintessential general performed a maneuver in which he manipulated the Roman forces to be encircled. With odds against him, Hannibal achieved victory against the famed Roman army. This battle was then on seen as the golden standard for battles as it was such a marvelous strategy. During World War II, Germany attempted to use the same strategy to achieve victory. Their plan was the Schlieffen Plan. Since the Germans also faced difficult odds, they resorted to the golden standard of the Battle of Cannae. However, the Germans did not succeed--this was likely because the fighting styles of 1905 CE and 215 CE were very different.
Throughout Roman history, the struggle between dictatorship and democracy swung back and forth like a pendulum. This conflict was exemplified the Social Wars. The same conflict was seen in the Cold War between the United States and Russia. The U.S. stood for democracy and Russia--while ostensibly identifying as communist--was a dictatorship. Both countries were fighting to decide which system of control was best.
Another element of dictatorship that is seen both in Roman and Contemporary history, it the end of the dictators term. This often happens through assassinations by a revolt. History was copied in such a close manner during the assassinations of dictators, that even the same words were used: Sic semper tyrannis, meaning, Thus always [I bring death to] tyrants. Two assassinations in Roman history were executed by a member of the same family of Brutus, the more famous of which was the assassination of Julius Caesar. The contemporary example of this event was the assassination of President Lincoln. The man who killed him also said the phrase.
Many events in history, especially Roman history, were repeated by others. This is because of the goal of writing history. Events in history tell a story, but they also show the viewpoints and values of the society that wrote them. When one decides to act as others did, they are taking upon the values that are represented in history. The German army wanted to be seen as a keen and powerful force, just as Hannibal was seen. The United States values democracy. John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln thought he was acting like a dictator and impeding upon his freedom. Studying history is important in order to understand the values of different societies. If those values are known, the future of societies that share the same values can be predicted.?"The Way gathers in emptiness alone. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."?Prompt: Talk about one religion, and how it is different from all the others (what makes it special essentially)

	Religious texts are ambiguous in a message and employ humor
	Meant to be questioned, therefore how can there be rules "Do you know what all things agree in calling right?" - Religious text asking what are the universal morals
Potential Rebuttal
	Although some objectives can be seen based on Fasting of the mind from Chuang-tzu
		? Don't listen with your ears
		? Don't listen with your mind
		? Do listen with your spirit
		? Listening stops with the ears
		? [Thinking] The mind stops with recognition
		? Spirit is empty and waits on all things.
		? "The Way gathers in emptiness alone. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."Humans have created many different religions, all with different rules, objectives, values, and gods. Many religions were initially developed around 400 BCE, and each religion created its own set of rules and objectives that would best guide its people. [The] emergence [of religions] was one of the most important revolutions in history, and made a vital contribution to the unification of humankind. (Sapiens 211). However, while many religions had rules and objectives and gods, there was one religion, Taoism, that does not have any of those things. Taoism is fundamentally different than all of the other religions, in that Taoism has no involvement with gods or rules or objectives.
Each religion has at least one goal for the follower, rule, or god. The three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, all have rules of conduct. Some of the three, mainly Judaism, focus on the material, as evidenced by the circumcision as a sacrifice to god. Christianity, however, focuses on spiritual devotion and sacrifice to god. This can be seen through the term circumcision of the heart. Islam also focuses on following the teaching of the Quran, which are the words of God. Furthermore, Judaism and Islam also have rules on dietary restriction. In terms of the objective of these three religions, the Christian Bible says, Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression (Bible, Isaiah 1:17). All of the Abrahamic religions have one god. That god played a role in the religious ancestors lives. Confucianism is a religion that is centered on rules. Confucianisms main teaching is Filial Piety, a son being in service to his father. Additionally, Confucianism has rules for all interactions in a social hierarchy. Buddhism is another religion with rules. While being less concrete, Buddhism says that people are suffering due to desire, so, one must not desire. When one removes desire, the can achieve the objective of Buddhism, ending suffering. Finally, Hinduism has a strict set of rules about following ones caste of life. When one follows the rules of their caste, they advance in the system. Hinduism says that there is a cyclical nature to life, and the objective is to remove ones self from the cycle, into a place called Moksha. Hinduism has many gods that can be prayed to, which will, in turn, have an effect on a persons life.
In contrast, Taoism is an ambiguous religion, that has no objectives, or strict rules, or an involvement with gods. The Tao, in Chinese, means The Way. One interpretation of Taoism is that it has one rule: follow The Way. However, this is not a rule because of the fact The Way has such a nebulous and contradicting definition, that there is no way to obey the rule of following The Tao at all.
Additionally, in its religious texts, Taoism touches on asking the questions of morals. Taoism does not provide the answer as a rule to follow, it only proposes the question, "Do you know what all things agree in calling right?" The Tao is open to any answer to what universal morals should be. The succeeding lines of the text venture into the abstract realm of questioning ones knowledge. "How would I know that? Do you know that you don't know it? (Tao Te Ching). These types of confusing questions are what make Taoism different, there is no one interpretation of the rules of Taoism, let alone the existence of rules at all. The religious text, the Chaung-Tzu, only asked the reader what morals are, it never produced a solution. Furthermore, The Tao, in Taoism, cannot be identified as one object or lesson. The opening line of the Tao Te Ching states, The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. In essence, this line can be interpreted to mean, if one thinks they know The Way or the rules, then they do not. This type of contradiction is what makes the rules of Taoism impossible to follow.
	Additionally, Taoism has gods, but they are not important to the center of Taoism: The Tao. At one point, however, Taoism introduces some followable rules. Don't listen with your ears, listen with your mind. No, don't listen with your mind, but listen with your spirit. Listening stops with the ears, the mind stops with recognition, but spirit is empty- and waits on all things. The Way gathers in emptiness alone. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind." (Chaung-Tzu). This too can be interpreted in many ways, however, the most important part of the line is, The Way gathers in emptiness alone. This could suggest that one must follow the Buddhist teachings of removing desires, but this is only one of the many possible interpretations of Taoism.
However, regardless of the rules, objectives, or number of gods, one idea that all religions of the world have in common, is that a higher truth, that can be realized through the practice of the religion, will set you free. In some religions, this can be the following of god or gods and their words, in others, such as Taoism, it can be the following of The Tao, whatever that means.
		?What differentiates homo sapiens from other humanoids? Essentially, what does it mean to be human? 
One of the defining characteristics of homo sapiens is our ability to use our complex language to augment our understanding of the world we live in. In my mind, this idea of language presents itself in two ways. These make us different from both our ancestors and other animals.
The first way our language is different from other animals is that homo sapiens have the ability to communicate not just about threats, and where the best places for food might be, we can communicate ideas. These ideas dont even always have to be about material things. The book states, [...] fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively. (Harari, p.25) This leads to my second point about language. While homo sapiens can communicate about imagined and real things, we also have the unique ability to gossip. Reliable information about who could be trusted meant that small bands could expand into larger bands, and Sapiens could develop tighter and more sophisticated types of cooperation. (Harari, p.24) Our gossip lead to trust which allows for groups larger than 150, Dunbars number. From an evolutionary standpoint, a bigger group with not only more strength and numbers, united by common beliefs and ideals, but also cooperation and strategic thinking, had an advantage over species that fall both under the homo genus and other predators. This ability to gossip leads to trust, or lack thereof, which also allows for trade. Like language and communication, trade is another scenario where homo sapiens used it both for materials and ideas. The trade of ideas sparks innovation which allows Sapiens to constanly be adapting, despite the fact that our DNA isn't changing. In conclusion, because of our complex and adaptable language, I think that the trade of ideas because of a mutual trust is the main phenomenon that makes us human.
?The Agricultural Revolution has had a negative effect on society. Although the effects of this mass shift in human civilization might not be obvious, there are both subtle and overt changes that took place.
Four of the main threats that came with the Agricultural Revolution are violence, fear, oppression, and the lack of diverse crops which leads to the lack of varied and important nutrients.
Violence came into the societal picture when Sapiens began to own land. Once Sapiens owned land, there was competition for the most arable, or the most expansive plot. Many anthropological and archaeological studies indicate that in simple agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village and tribe, human violence was responsible for about 15 percent of deaths, including 25 percent of male deaths. (Harari, P. 82) This is a large number of casualties, and it wasnt until cities and kingdoms began to form that the violence that came with ownership could be kept at bay. Despite our attempts to keep it under control, even today land is still a source of violence, and it has been the impetus for many wars.
Along with the fear of your land being taken away, a completely foreign concept, there was also fear of disease. Disease became more common once humans were domesticated by wheat and other crops. In farming villages, the probability for disease to spread was much higher than that of the foragers who were constantly relocating.
Before the Agricultural Revolution, Sapiens foraged for their own resources, but as farming became a prevalent part of human society, so did oppression. The labor-intensive work done on farms required many more workers, and the farm owners simply couldnt take care of everything by themselves. The result of this mass shift of labor was the concept that people could work for each other. This was the catalyst for slavery. Its hard to imagine a system where everyone was equal, but thats because our way of life has become so ingrained in us that we cant see how it used to be.
Lastly, with the advance of the Agricultural Revolution, farms specialized in a specific crop. This led to malnutrition. As foragers, we were used to a variety of nutrients, but during the Agricultural Revolution, our body had to adjust to a new, more simple, diet. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. (Harari, P. 79) Along with the less healthy diet, the wave of farming brought uncertainty with it. If a years worth of crops failed, the sapiens had no backup. Village life certainly brought the first farmers some immediate benefits [...], yet for the average person, the disadvantages probably outweighed the advantages. (Harari, P. 82)
In conclusion, since today we appreciate a plentiful supply of food, and the bounty was curated by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that it was a beneficial step in human history. We are blinded by the convenience and multitude, and we dont see that were now trapped in a problem of our own creation. There is no logical way to return back to how things used to be, but things cant stay how they are now. In time, well come across the next big step that hopefully improves our life more than it takes away from it.
"I have neither given nor received unauthorized help on this work."?Learn From Before
From studying the Roman Empire, the similarities between events and stories of ancient Rome and present-day America show that America is an Empire. An empire is a political order with two important characteristics. First, to qualify for that designation you have to rule over a significant number of distinct people, each possessing a different cultural identity and separate territory. [...] Second, empires are characterized by flexible borders and a potentially unlimited appetite. (Harari, 190) This means that size and flexibility are required to sustain an empire.
At the height of the Roman empire, it spanned more than five million square kilometers and encompassed a plethora of diverse cultures. One driving force for Roman expansion was the law that a Roman citizen could not be enslaved. Therefore, Rome needed to conquer other regions to sustain their way of life. While Americas reason for expansion didnt have to do with slavery, after industrialization, the demand for international markets required growth. This lead America towards imperialism, the economic, military, and cultural influence on other countries. The first appearance of American imperialism came with the Louisiana Purchase. This expansion reshaped the lives of Native Americans and forced the tradition and culture of the settlers on a previously thriving society.  "Building and maintaining an empire usually required the vicious slaughter of large populations and the brutal oppression of everyone who was left."(Harari, 193) To justify their cruelty, Americans and Romans fueled their movement towards imperialism with exceptionalism, the idea that they had a responsibility to spread their superior cultures and customs. 
When we look back through history, we see that after the glorious peak of the Roman empire, due to the rise of populism, the republic began to collapse. As America grows, we need to look back to Rome and see what could be done differently to prevent its fall. If America closes down its borders, it faces the threat of potential collapse. Cultural diversity and territorial flexibility give empires not only their unique character, but also their central role in history. (Harrari, 190) Diversity is key to sustain an empire.
History never repeats itself but it often rhymes. (Mark Twain) America is an empire, teetering on the edge of catastrophe. In 63BCE, Rome had its last chance to survive.  America, look behind you, what happened before? We dont want a rhyme, we dont have much time. The people are suffering and America is hovering,  right between glory and shame, Rome did the same. Learn from the past, it opens the door, to knowledge aplenty, and much much more.
 ?Christianity was formed from Judaism. The splitting off of Christianity from Judaism initially began in the first century of the common era in Jerusalem, which, at the time, was under Roman rule. Initially, Christianity was merely a sect of Judaism that believed in the story of Jesus. However, Christianity became independent of Judaism due to two fundamental changes: the ease of conversion and the abstraction of values. The early Christians changed Christianity to best support the needs of conversion.
First, Judaism did not seek to convert new subjects. Judaism was a tribal religion, shared between a small group of individuals. Early Christianity shared the same values as Judaism, but instead, Christians wanted to expand their religion and share it with others. Early Christians sought to convert the occupying Romans, but they ran into a problem: the Romans wouldnt accept Judaisms strict concrete values, such as limiting the diet, and especially circumcision. Circumcision in Judaism is seen as a sacrifice to god in return for benefaction from god. However, the Romans were reluctant to sacrifice such things, especially since the Romans commonly ate many foods and were culturally open sexually--another Christian and Jewish idea was being against homosexuality, which was acceptable to the Romans. Combined with these problems, the Christians needed to construct a system of values that would be more easily accepted by the Romans.
So, the Christians changed, their religion of Christianity by abstracted their values and to decrease the physical sacrifice of conversion. The new Christian values did not employ dietary restrictions, nor did they require a literal circumcision. Instead, the Christians proposed the circumcision of the heart. To further ease the conversion process, Christians needed the process to be as simple as possible. In essence, only four truths needed to be accepted: Jesus is special; he died for the Christians sins; Be a good person, this is the idea of the circumcision of the heart; and Jesus will return. Having accepted those four ideas, a Roman need only be baptized or cleansed of his sin. Initially, this process was as easy as dumping water over the convertees head.
But why would a Roman bother to convert to Christianity? Christianity offers life after death, provided that one was good in life, in heaven. Therefore, all a Roman needed to do to continue living once he was dead, was to agree to four ideas and be a good person. These abstract Christian values were much easier for the Romans to accept than the concrete Jewish sacrifices were.
In summary, Christianity developed from Judaism and at first had a goal, to gain members. The new system of conversion conflicted with the old Jewish tribal values. To solve this problem, the Christians developed a new system of values that was more easily accepted by the Romans. Convertibility was the first major difference between Judaism and Christianity. 
[Ease of conversion, however, was not the first change to befall Christianity through its development. Christianity would continue to develop to fit the needs of its leaders?]
COMMENT on the line above: If I had more time, I might research about when the idea of paying churches came around. I thought that another way that Christianity might have developed was that Constantine (I know we didnt go over this in class but I would have looked it up) said that the churches could charge people money to benefit his rule. Again, I dont know if that actually was the case but this was just an idea I had that I wanted to express but didnt know how to incorporate into my essay. By the time I am finished writing this comment, however, I likely would have had enough time to research it but not fit it into my idea.?Religions are like orchestras. They can play gorgeous music when all working together, but just like the wood body of a violin or the reeds of a wind instrument, they can swell and shrink, crack or slip, resulting in dissonance.
	In an orchestra, the conductor has control of the whole group, and with the full score in front of them, they are seen to be omniscient. Like an orchestras conductor, each Abrahamic religion has one god: the supreme power. As stated in Judaism, Christianity and Islam - Comparison, Judaism, Islam, or Christianity -- all believe in an omniscient God, prophets [...]. Dissecting this quote, we see that one similarity between these religions is they believe in one overarching power. While the prophets in each religion may differ, the idea that some divine person was told by God to pass on knowledge and wisdom to the people occurs in all three of the religions. As in an orchestra, there can be a soloist, a prophet, who both leads and follows the people. They work together to create something beautiful.
	In the realm of beauty, all of the holy books in the Abrahamic religions are of great importance, just as the music is to the musicians. Both religion and music use text to guide their actions. All three religions use text as a central part of their religion, but they use it in different ways. For example, one contrast between Judaism and Islam is the way in which they view their respective holy books. In Judaism, there is a strong emphasis on deep textual understanding and interpretation of the Torah. This can be likened to the creativity and exploration of the music in jazz. But, as said on Quranic Inerrancy - Wikipedia, Quranic inerrancy is a doctrine central to the Muslim faith that the Quran is the infallible and inerrant word of God as revealed to Muhammad by the archangel Gabriel. This reveals that unlike the interpretation of the Torah, Islam sees the Quran as the words of God, through Muhammad, that are divine and unchanging. In classical music, the notes written on the page are worshipped and followed explicitly.
	While religion and music have a transcendental power, they both have the possibility to be taken to the extremes, or out of tune, as well. All three of the Abrahamic religions have instances of religious extremism, just like when the orchestra is out of tune, everyone can be playing the same music, but a dissonant cacophony of sound is produced rather than a mutual understanding and harmony. Religion can unify and divide, discriminate against and welcome, but like the Abrahamic religions and an orchestra, everyone in and following them has a great power to choose to come together and embrace peace over viol(e)in-ce, and to ob(o)e-y the divine word. This creates something magnificent.

TAOISM
Taoism is pure philosophy. It stands out because, while all religions have philosophical components, Taoism is built on the idea of philosophy. Not having prescribed morality also sets Taoism apart. Its a religion that recognizes the enormity of understanding everything and confesses that there is no prescribed method of attainment.
The first religion compared to Taoism is Confucianism. The fundamental principles of Confucianism are to know your place and live with respect. Confucianism has a strong emphasis on relationships and knowing how to act within them. This is a religion that can be practiced and prescribed, and if you follow the rules, you are guaranteed to go to Tian, heaven. Adversely, The Way has never known boundaries; speech has no constancy. (The Tao-te Ching) To know your place, as Confucianism requires, means that there are boundaries, and if you can never know anything for sure, then it is not worth trying to seek unknowable knowledge.
Out of the religions compared to Taoism in this writing, Buddhism shares some of the ideology, but there are also discrepancies. The core idea of Buddhism is that ego-based desires cause you pain. Dont try to avoid the inevitable. Taoism agrees with the fundamental idea of freedom from desire, as shown in this quote. Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. (The Tao-te Ching) This shows that desires only let the shell of your being be visible. While there are similarities between the two religions, one difference is the idea of Dukkha, the unenlightened life, thats presented in Buddhism. In Buddhism, if you work to subdue your mind to become enlightened, you can reach the point of omniscience. The philosophy of Taoism states that there is and never will be any way to know everything, and therefore, it is the choice to let the river of life, the tao, guide you.
	Buddhism asks you to find your role on your own, and by doing this, you will reach enlightenment. But, in Hinduism, you are born with a role, your Dharma, and it is your job to serve in that role to your best ability. Success to do so results in reincarnation, Samsara. In Hinduism, the ultimate goal is a release from the cycle altogether. The philosophy of Taoism says that there is no release from the cycle because while the cycle is both existent and nonexistent, its a figment of the imagination. Therefore, since your arrangement of atoms, your being, isnt truly you, the only way forward is to follow the tao.
The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. (The Tao-te Ching) This is the definition of the Tao, the way, from the Tao-te Ching. It best explains Taoism because in saying that the way isnt actually the way, it illustrates that the more you seek the answers, the further away from them youve actually become. By naming the tao, its no longer the tao. This pure philosophical paradox of Taoism sets it apart from the other religions.
?The Renaissance was the beginning of a new set of ideas about what it meant to be alive, one that embraced culture, art, and philosophy. The Reformation was a different set of ideas, of faith and free will, that strived to answer the same question. In the end, the Renaissance and Reformation teach us that ideas are just ideas, with no moral connection.
	The renaissance was the search to revive old ideas and to bring back the perspectives and views on humanity and life in general from the ancient thinkers and philosophers. This was in the hopes that they could find knowledge about purpose through those ideas. During this period, some of the most renowned art, music, and ideas came about, but even today we havent found out the purpose of living and how to go about it.
	The antithesis to the radical and new, yet ancient and old, ideas of the Renaissance was the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation, led by the passionate priest Martin Luther, looked down on the ideas of humanism that came from the Renaissance and feared that society was becoming distant from God and the true purpose of living. Prior to the Reformation, the church sold indulgences, a get-out-of-jail-free card, that, through the payment of the citizens, erased their sin. Martin Luther and the Reformation believed that this was the result of a corrupt church, and that to truly find your purpose and connect with God, you could read the bible for yourself and interpret the words in it to find your own purpose as long as you were a devout catholic. 
	Looking at both these periods of immense change in lifestyles and ideas, there is a common thread: Both of these times teach us that ideas are just ideas and people are no more enlightened today then they were back then. These two radical ways of thinking have shaped the world today, but even today people grapple with the purpose of living and how to live well.
?Prompt: How do other elements of identity (culture, gender, sexual orientation, wealth, citizenship, etc.) impact the characters' mental health and ability to receive/get help?
	Some elements of identity in the book I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter were dichotomous, while others were groups within an umbrella category. While not necessarily reflecting the way these identities exist outside of the story, the identities seen as dichotomous in the story were: cultural identity, either mexican or white; gender, either male or female--as aforementioned, as the identities are seen in the story; citizenship, either a citizen or, as Julias family says, ilegales[, or illegals] (166).; and wealth, either rich or poor. With these dichotomous identities, one side causes more harm to the characters mental health and ability to receive help, while the other provides support.
In terms of cultural identity, as aforementioned, the book addresses two main identities: white and mexican. Obviously, there are more than just those, but for the purposes of the book, they will be compared in terms of their impact on a characters mental health and access to resources regarding it. To begin with, one example of the divergence in cultural identity, is when Connor uses an innuendo that intimates that since Julia is not white, she is from somewhere else. The other place in this case, for both Julia and many in her world is Mexico. Where are you from from? (174). In terms of how this identity affects a characters characters mental health, the cultural identity is strongly connected to a wealth identity. Julia and her other Mexican friends are, as the book says, low-income, While Connor, a white person, is wealthy. While wealth is not the sole determinant of ones mental status--in fact a lot of wealth can have a negative impact on mental health--it does, in fact, contribute in many cases. An example of this is where Julia skipped eating lunch for extended periods in order to save money. This physical deprivation due to poverty, if not harmed Julias mental health, did nothing to improve it. However, when it comes to receiving help for mental health issues, the difference between cultural identities and wealth is not seen due to the fact that Julias low-income insurance covers her expenses. Additionally, there were other patients in the hospital where Julia stayed that could be considered non-white and or Mexican. However, just as cultural identity is connected to wealth, there are other factors involved in a characters mental health. 
Gender identity in the book was not discussed to the extent that non-binary genders played an important role in any characters in the story. This is why gender was chosen as a dichotomic identity example for the story. However, gender identity was explored in terms of stereotypes. This can be seen because of Amas beliefs on the role of women. Ama says, What kind of girl doesnt know when a tortilla is done? (32).
One example of a possible difference between the gender identities is that of Apa. While it was not explained in depth in the book, one common stereotype for males is that they shouldnt show their feelings. In the book, Apa is described as merely being physically present in the household, but communicating on very rare occasions. This expected lack of communication could act as a barrier for Apa to relieve stress to improve his mental health. One, albeit slightly unrelated, example is Julias knowledge that talking about her period with her male teachers which both makes the teachers uncomfortable and also can be used as an escape from stress for her. This however, hass less to do with gender identity, and more sexual identity. However, the fact that the male teachers, in addition to others, have the stereotypical expectation that girls are emotional might be more beneficial to Julia in that it is more normal for her to express emotion as a girl than if she were a boy. However, these stereotypes may be different, especially in regards to the cultural lenses. When it comes to gaining help for mental health, since there were an equal number of boys as girls in Julias recovery group, there is no obvious bias one way or another.
	One of the clearest dichotomies is that one citizenship. Without citizenship, one cannot get certain benefits such as healthcare. This inhibits those who do not have citizenship ability to get help for mental health issues. When Julia was discussing terms used to describe citizenship of people with Mr. Ingman--either the tame undocumented, or the negative, illegal The idea of illegal immigration also ties into cultural identity, in that youre either part of the group, or youre not. --she mentioned, My parents could have been sent back to Mexico at any moment, leaving me and Olga here to fend for ourselves. (167). The fact that her parents were in such a tenuous situation is both bad for the mental health of Julia and Olga because they could their parents could be kicked out at any time, but also the situation could make it difficult for Julia and Olga to receive help for their mental health unless they were put into foster care.--Another stressful system. 
Lastly, in regards to wealth, there are two stages denoted by the book: rich or poor. However, like with other identities, there are innuendos for the identities that might be considered bad, in that societal pressure causes mental health issues because of them. An example of the innuendo is when Julia is receiving her medical treatment--an exception to the intuition that poverty would make getting help for mental health issues more difficult. [Dr. Cooke] didnt use the word poor, she said  low-income, but its the same thing. I guess it just sounds more polite. (219). While access to help may not be severely restricted for those who are impoverished, their overall mental state is likely to be negatively affected. When Ama wanted to celebrate Olgas quinceaera though Julia, one of Julias concerns was about the finance of the party. It is not conducive to good mental health if the ability to have good experiences is limited by money. There is another layer of complexity to the situation because of the fact that Ama really wanted to celebrate Olga and not Julia, but she didnt have enough money at the time. Julia remarked, I dont even know where theyre getting the money. All they ever do is complain about how poor we are. (65). The complaints about the lack of money also can lead to poor mental health because of focusing on the negative. But oftentimes, Julia has no choice but to focus on the negative of not having money in order to best conserve what little money she does have. When Julia saw a girl with an expensive doll that she thought was a waste of money, she commented, I cant wait until I have enough money to buy whatever the hell I want without worrying about every single penny. (41). Her worry about the smallest amount of money, the penny, reinforces that it is an issue for her that is not supporting her happiness.
In conclusion, of the pairs of identities that were observed, each had a level of conductivity towards good mental health. Oftentimes, the identities that Julia identified with were the ones that were more conducive to poor mental health. However, as seen by the fact that Julia makes good progress on her mental health toward the end of the story, the identities Julia had did not stop her from getting help and improving. An application of the understanding gained by the simple dichotomous identities in the book to the real world might be understanding that there are many different identities, and some are more conducive to having good mental health because of the stigmas and stereotypes around them. However, it is important to note that while identities are a part of you, they dont bind you. Just as Julia did experience depression and anxiety, she was able to live a more mental health positive life in the end.
?The study of Roman history shows that the culture and ideology set a precedent for future societies. One of the ways Roman history shaped the societies of today is through the Battle of Cannae. In this battle, the Carthagenians used a new technique called the Fabian Strategy where instead of moving an army forward, the middle of the line moves back, trapping the other army in a circle. In the case of the Carthagenians, this tactic proved that through strategy and perseverance, even a smaller, inexperienced army can win. Though this battle happened over 2,000 years ago, many famous commanders have tried implementing this strategy, such as George Washington during the Revolutionary War. By studying the history of the Battle of Cannae and the unexpected victory of the Carthagenians makes the Fabian Strategy compelling to the societies who are in a similar situation. During the Revolutionary War, it was apparent that the American army was nowhere near as large and as powerful as the British Army. Through the idea that despite having a lacking army it is possible to win against your enemy, the Americans ultimately won the war. This means that the war tactics and ideology used in Roman history gave inspiration to wars much later in history.
	One of the most famous lines used throughout Roman history is Sic Semper Tyrannis or Thus always to tyrants. It was used by Brutus during the assassination of Julius Caesar to form the Roman Republic, and was later used during the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln. The ideology behind the phrase is that kings cannot rule a society, and instead a government system where the power is more evenly spread out should be used. The Romans were one of the first to use the idea of democracy and separation of powers, which in turn inspired the idea of the US government system of checks and balances. During Caesars reign, he abused his power and thus the phrase Sic Semper Tyrannis was made, as a protest to his rule. This moment in Roman history inspired the assassination of Lincoln; according to the assassin he was abusing his power and acting like a king. Though the assassination of Caesar happened nearly 2,000 years ago, the effect of this moment inspired the ideology of people throughout history. By studying Roman culture, you can see parallels between what happened then and the ideology of the people today. ?Abstract:
Understanding how enzymes interact and how to optimize their function is a foundational concept used across medical fields and has directly contributed to lifesaving treatments. Our enzymatic research investigated catalase (an enzyme), seeking to understand the optimal conditions to break down hydrogen peroxide. We hypothesized that catalase would break down hydrogen peroxide faster as the concentration of catalase got higher. To test our hypothesis we measured exactly three milliliters of water and three milliliters of hydrogen peroxide into a test tube. Then we added 50 microliters of catalase and corked the tube with a pressure reader. We then increased the amount of catalase by fifty microliters and repeated the tests for the following measurements of catalase: 50, 100, 150, and 200 microliters. As a control test, we mixed the same volume of hydrogen peroxide and water, but did not add catalase. Our results supported our hypothesis because, even with the anomalous data points at 50 and 200 microliters, our data followed a consistent rise of pressure to catalase increase. The optimization of the enzyme is important for humans because it breaks down hydrogen peroxide within our cells. Increasing the effectiveness of catalase can in turn increase health.
Figure 1. Slope of pressure by enzyme concentration
The slope of pressure is the rate at which pressure within the test tube increased in a consistent linear fashion. Increase in pressure indicated how quickly the enzyme was catalyzing because oxygen gas is a product of this enzyme and substrate reaction. Enzyme concentration is measured in microliters of the amount of enzyme added.?Has farming been good or bad for humanity?

Over time humans have been domesticated by numerous forms of wildlife, which has lessened our health in comparison to our former hunter-gather society.
Before the agriculture revolution, humans lived hunter-gather lives, this meant that they lived in small groups and changed locations frequently. This leads to a balanced diet and less widespread disease. Around 10,000 years ago this way of life that sapiens had practiced for 2.5 million years rapidly changed. During this change, the Agriculture revolution, humans devoted more time to cultivating wheat. This work had a huge physical demand, in many cases, humans knees, spines, necks, etc. were permanently altered and caused pain. Wheat didnt like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing fields (Harari, 80) Moreover, the nutritious results were not synchronous to the labor that was necessary to keep wheat thriving; It did not offer a better diet. (Harari, 81) So why did humans work so hard for an inadequate result?
Farming leads to humans living in larger groups and staying put. In addition, most of the humans that were farming had only one or two crops. A large but cramped village of 1,000 people, who suffered far more from disease and malnourishment. (Harari, 83) The large numbers of people in small spaces resulted in diseases spreading between more humans which lead to more of them dying. In addition, since sapiens only relied on a few specific types of crops, if a disease killed all of a crop the humans would starve.
 
In conclusion, farming has lead to humans having less balanced diets and diseases that spread at rapid rates. With all of the evidence and information presented above scientists estimate that the main reason for the agriculture revolution is that all species (wheat and sapiens) want to produce as many DNA copies of themselves as possible, even if the living conditions are worse than what they once were.

Symbolism in Small Country
A story without symbols is like a cake without icing. (Brian Crawford, 2019).
Symbolism is critical in story representation and animation. Using objects, elements, or nature, to represent concepts gives authors the ability to demonstrate character growth within their environment. Symbols bring life to stories through repetition, appearance in important moments, and experience within culture. In Small Country, the author, Gal Faye uses symbols to represent the protagonist, Gabriels character growth. As Gabriel (or Gaby, as he is often called), aged ten, deals with corrosive social structure, contentious famiy, and genocide, the author uses symbolism to represent his identity development in warring world.
One of the most important natural symbols of Gabys childhood is mangoes. Mangoes are present every time Gaby is reflecting on, or experiencing an event related to his childhood. The first mango reference is in a scene describing the shenanigans of the Kinyanera Boyz, Gabys social club. Gaby showcases his immaturity through his ignorance of societal values. The Kinyanera Boyz ethical failings are evident when they try to steal the Von Gotzens mangoes from outside the garden wall. Back on home turf, we [Gaby and company] had our eyes on the big, fat juicy mangoes hanging in the Von Gotzens garden. (58). Assuming the juiciest mangoes represent the quintessence of childhood, the boys have been blocked from their most juvenile desires. Additionally, the Von Gotzens racism is mirrored by governments racism. The
wall blocking Gaby from mangoes represents the racism that will soon rip him from his haven of innocence. Mangoes appear again in the rising and falling of a scene where Francis, the Kinyanera Boyz adversary, attempts to drown Gaby and his best friend, Gino after he catches the Kinyanera Boyz trying to steal mangoes from his garden. Gaby and Gino are upset because they were nearly drowned. Despite his fear of Francis, Gaby goes back to Franciss house to retrieve their discarded mango picking rods, however, he leaves the mangoes to rot, alluding to the decomposition of his innocence. I picked up our rods and left the mangoes behind. Nobody would collect them now. [...] I couldnt have cared less about those mangoes rotting on the fresh grass. (106). This is a pivotal moment of firsts for Gaby, his first experience of real violence and the first time he puts someone elses needs above his own.
After nearly being drowned, Gino bonds with Francis over their dead mothers, and invites him into the club. When Gino informs the Kinyanera Boyz that Francis is in, Francis takes the gang to a school outside Bujumbura in the war zone to swim. In the taxi, the story references the road, saying, Mango trees laden with fruit adorned the main road, chausse Prince Louis Rwagasore. Gino tooted the horn when we spotted some kids from another neighborhood picking off mangoes with their long rods. (126). The trees with fruit and the young boys picking it were Gabys last glimpse at the childhood that had rotted away. Water serves as a symbol of rebirth, which we find when Gaby swims with his club. Gaby jumps off the high dive and is extolled by his friends just before being shooed away. They all run in their, birth-day suits (129), to the taxi and leave. Gabys childhood is over now that he left behind the mangoes and was reborn through the water. A baptism of sorts took place when Gaby went into the pool and shifted from an immature mindset into that of an adolescent.
Gabys new maturity is reiterated when Gaby and his friends split because of politics. After the war picks up in Burundi and the start of the genocide in Rawanda, Gaby spends time with an old Greek woman from whom he used to steal mangoes. Madame Economopolus teaches him the value of books, where he finds solace. He has lost hope, and simultaneously learns to value sources of hope. Later, Gaby meets up with his friends and finds out that they have stolen Madame Economopoloss telescope. He is vexed and tells them to give it back. His old friends retort, You conned the Greek lady, too. That was before! And anyway, its not the same with mangoes I tried to grab hold of the telescope, but Gino pushed me backward. (152). To Gaby, the mangoes are different because, in his immature eyes, the mangoes regenerated, so stealing them isnt as bad. He realizes that he didnt want to let go of the repose of innocence, only after losing it. Gaby enjoys the books and relationship Madame Economopolus gives him because it gives him hope of living past the war. The telescope symbolizes hope, and is used to see the stars and sky, often associated with freedom and accomplishment. It also represents the hope that he fears losing by harming Madame Economopolus. He knows the value of predictability because of what he has lost. In addition, telescopes are used to see clearly. Gaby learns that stealing is wrong, and reflects back on himself. After his friends tell him they wont give the telescope back, Gaby tries to take it by force. He latches onto it in an effort to get it back, like his hope.
As a final homage to his childhood and his wish to, make a fortress of my happiness and
a chapel of my innocence. (159), Gaby writes a letter to his penpal Laure filled with white objects, consistently repeating the line, Its been snowing for days and nights over Bujumbura.
(174). It does not snow in Bujumbura. Water is present in moments of change and pain, and
snow is frozen water. He is torn up about being coerced to kill and now his feelings are askew. What Gaby is referencing is something his father said to him; written in a letter to his deceased cousin, Christian. My father told me that on the day men stop waging war on one another, it will snow over the tropics. (161). The repeated line is similar to the expression, hell will freeze over. Hell is freezing over, but the war in Bujumbura is far from over and Gaby is still surrounded by bloodshed. Prior to the letter to Laure, Gaby was forced to burn alive a hutu man who killed a friends father, as if burning in hellfire for his sin. The hell Gaby is in then freezes over and he means it as the end of his war with himself to find a place and stop struggling. In addition, Gaby writes in the letter, Street children are decorating pine trees with red, yellow, and green, mangoes. (174). He has lost the last of his innocence after being forced to kill the hutu man and now writes that the world is upside down with the tropics freezing over. He wants peace as the doves and white flags in his letter fly over Bujumbura. Gaby fills his writing with white, only adding in color with mangoes. White is often a symbol of purity and he has lost his. He was filled with horror from stories of his dead cousins, he lost his friends, he killed a man.
The letter is filled with what he wants. He wants his innocence and his childhood from the
mangoes; he wants the war to end and his hell to freeze over, to have snowfall over the tropics; he wants the purity he lost when he burned the hutu.
The use of symbols throughout Small Country is intentional and precise to go along with Gabys development from child to adult. The symbols provide an engaging element and a deeper level to the writing, as a mechanism for proof of construct. Using symbols to externalize characters internal struggles is an effective way to write character traits and existence. Readers are able to better relate to the characters because they dont only have the people to go by, rather
the context and solid representatives. To use symbolism in this way gives readers a deeper level of understanding and sympathy as they can see the story unfold through the characters and the environment.?Zo Predmore

In nature, survival is often a matter of being able to adapt and resist. Often, microevolution is what allows organisms to survive, and this same pattern is repeated over and over, even in tiny organisms; like yeast. We experimented on yeast in order to try to answer the following questions; can we observe microevolution in our yeast populations? And which strain of yeast is best adapted to resist fungicure? We wanted to observe this certain kind of evolution, microevolution, on a macroscopic scale to help us better understand how microevolution works on a bigger scale. We conducted the experiment by first putting two yeast strains (each dyed with a different color, so we could differentiate them later on) into two different tubes, one with and one without fungicure (an anti-fungal medication). Because this medication is working to kill the yeast, strains that grow in population in the fungicure will show that they have adapted to resist the medicine. Two or three days later we would transfer the yeast from each tube into a petri dish of yeast food and let it colonize over three or four days. We would then count the colonies of yeast for each color, and whichever color had a larger increase of colonies from the dish without fungicure to the dish with fungicure was the winner of that stage, and would move on to the next round (this was conducted ten times with eight different colored strains, three of which are shown in figures 1, 2, and 3). Although, in our final competition, we observed yellow having a larger increase in population than white (Figure 3), data collected from others conducting the same experiment leads us to think that white is the strain of yeast most adapted to resist fungicure. We (with the help of data from others) found that white was more adapted than any of the other yeast strains because its population always increased in fungicure. From this data, we can conclude that we were successfully able to observe microevolution within or yeast populations, as we watched the white yeast strain evolve to resist the medicine. This also answers our question; which strain of yeast can best adapt to resist fungicure, with white being our winner. Observing the yeast strains allows us to study microevolution at work at a macroscopic level, and to consider how larger organisms are able to adapt to resist problems they might face.

Abstract
The traits of organisms are determined by the genes that they inherit from their parents gametes (sex cells) and whether the allele they have are dominant or reccesive. While studying yeast my class wanted to determine which color trait (red and cream) was dominant and if the trait giveing the organism the ability to grow without the amino acid leucine is dominant or not. Our other purpose for conducting this experiment was to attain evidence that would support Mendel's Laws of Segregation and Independent Assortment. To find this evidence my lab partner and I crossed red colored yeast that had the ability to grow without leucine with cream colored yeast that couldn't grow without leucine. After the yeast had joined together, yeast tetrads were separated into spores that were left to grow on a petri dish with leucine and without. We found that from the yeast cross all the yeast strains (offspring) were cream colored and had the ability to grow without leucine. We also found that equal numbers of the spores grown had the traits of red color and cream color and the ability to grow without leucine or not. Also, in the group of spores grown, all possible combinations of the two traits were present. The results show that the inheritance pattern for the color and ability to grow is Complete dominance with the trait of cream color dominant over red color and the trait of the ability to grow without leucine dominant over the trait of needing leucine to grow. Examples of Mendel's Laws of Segregation and Independent Assortment are seen in the data collected on the yeast spores. Because genotypes of the spores from a singular tetrad were all different the traits couldn't have been inherited by a spore together, they must have been inherited independently, resulting in the different genotypes. This evidence proves Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment. Mendel's other law, the Law of Segregation, says that out of the traits of the spores from the yeast cross, half would have one allele and half would have the other. This is seen in the data of the groups of spores where the two traits of color and ability to grow were equally present in the population.
Introduction
Gregor Mendel, a scientist who worked in the 1800s on genetics, discovered fundamental principles of genetics that are known as Mendel's Laws (Miko, 2008). These laws are The Law of Segregation and The Law of Independent Assortment. The Law of Segregation states that when gametes (sex cells like sperms and eggs) form, the two alleles of a single trait from the parent seperate so a gamete only carries one allele. This leads to the fact that for every gene, each parent contributes one allele. Mendel's other law, The Law of Independent Assortment, states that the allele a gamete gets for one gene is not affected by and has no effect on another allele it gets for another trait. To make these laws more clear, a chromosome is a structure that carries genetic information in the form of genes which determine the characteristics of an organism. And an allele is an alternate form of a certain gene. Although an individual might have a certain allele for a trait contained in one of their chromosomes, this trait is not always the trait that gets expressed. This is because of inheritance patterns. The two main inheritance patterns that were important in this experiment were autosomal dominance and autosomal recessiveness. Autosomal means that the alleles for these traits are not located on sex chomosomes, which means that the sex of an organism does not affect the likleyhood of having the trait expressed. Dominance of an allele is where in an individual with a recessive and a dominant allele, the trait of the dominant allele will be expressed. And the opposite is true of a recessive allele, so that if an individual has a recessive and dominant allele, the trait of the recessive allele will not be expressed. For an organism to express the trait of a recessive allele, the organism must have the recessive allele on both chromosomes.
In the experiment my class did, we used yeast to determine the inheritance pattern of certain traits and to find evidence for Mendel's laws. The yeast we used reproduces in two ways. The first is called budding, where a single yeast splits its nucleus and grows another yeast cell that splits off, taking half of the nucleus. The offsping of this asexual reproduction is called a haploid that has one copy of every chromosome which contain the same DNA as its parent cell. The second way of yeast reproduction involves two yeast cells. The two yeast cells join and become a diploid which has two copies of each chromosome, then both split their nucleuss to make two haploid spores or two gametes. This group of four yeast gametes is called a tetrad. In the experiment my class did we used and observed offspring from both of these reproduction methods. We crossed yeast using the sexual reproduction method of yeast to find the inheritance patterns of four specific traits. The first two traits were the color of the yeast, with two different alleles, one for the trait of cream yeast color and the other for red color. The other two traits involved the essential amino acid leucine that is generally used in the biosynthesis of proteins, and used specifically by yeast to make proteins (Leucine). These traits were the ability to grow on a plate that did not contain leucine in the yeast food and the trait of not being able to grow on a plate without leucine.

Results
The offspring of the original cross (Figure 1.) of red colored yeast with the ability to grow without leucine and cream colored yeast without the ability to grow without leucine grew on a plate without leucine observed to be cream colored (Figure 2.). From the plate of yeast strains grown from the gametes from the original cross (Figure 3.) and from the stamped yeast observed on the stamped plate without leucine (Figure 2.) there were 9 yeast strains that were red colored and had the ability to grow without leucine, 7 strains that were red and needed leucine to grow, 7 that were cream colored and had the ability to grow without leucine, and 9 that were cream colored and needed leucine (Figure 5.). From the same plates (Figure 3 and 4) 16 strains grown from the gametes had the trait of red color, 16 had the trait of cream colored, 16 had the ability to grow without leucine, and 16 needed leucine to grow.
Conclusion
The inheritance pattern for the traits of color in yeast are dominant for the trait of cream coloring and recessive for the trait of red coloring. This is shown in the fact that when the red yeast was mated with the cream colored yeast, the offspring strain was cream colored (Figure 2.). The inheritance patterns for the trait of being able to grow without leucine and the trait of needing leucine to grow are dominant and recessive. Because the offspring of the cross of yeast with the ability to grow without leucine and without the ability were able to grow on a plate that did not have leucine (Figure 2.), then the ability to grow without leucine must be dominant. Evidence of Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment was found in the combination of the traits in the strains grown from the gametes of the dissected tetrads. If traits were inherited together then all of the strains would have the same combination of traits, but as seen in Figure 5 there were four combinations of traits that the strains of yeast exhibited. Only if traits were independently inherited by the yeast offspring would you have such a variety of trait combinations. The principles of Mendel's other law state that because on allele is inherited from one parent and one from the other, half of the gametes of the dissected tetrad would have one trait and half would have another. In the traits counted from the strains grown from the gametes there was an equal presence of all traits in the population, showing that they had been equally inherited. Although yeast and humans are very different organisms, yeast like humans have DNA. So using yeast to understand more about DNA by conduction of experiments like this help us understand the relatively recent discovery that is the human genome.

Both renaissance and the reformation, though having conflicting ideas, present us with a pattern showing humans viewing themselves as good. The Renaissance and Reformation teach us that during periods of social change humans often like to view themselves as good,  beautiful, and/or more correct than others. Finding this pattern throughout history allows us to gain a deeper understanding of human nature and take this trend into account as we face current day challenges.
The Renaissance resulted in great social and artistic change in European culture. The art produced during this time period represented humans in a very detailed and beautiful way. This new attention to detail and representing the human form and its beauty showcases how people see themselves as good. It does this because when painting the artists personal opinion/ biases on humans shines through, and an artists personal opinion on humans can be partially formed by the way they view themselves. The idea that humans are good and beautiful as represented in the idealized beauty of renaissance art can also be seen in the reformation.
The reformation, though the ideals were very different from the renaissance, also provides us with an example of humans viewing themselves as good. Martin Luther was against the idea of the pope selling indulgences, he believed that it was wrong and that prayer was what one should do in order to get into heaven. He also believed that there should not even be a pope because one is never mentioned in the bible. Martin Luther and the pope had differing opinions, interpretations of the bible, and Christianity as a whole, but they both view themselves as right and good. Moreover, one of Martin Luthers main messages was that everyone should read the bible and then form opinions for themselves, but when people read it and formed ideas that disagreed with his, he said they were wrong. These examples from the Reformation show the common belief that humans have during periods of change that ones self is more righteous and more morally correct (good) than others. 
This all shows us that even though the renaissance and the reformation had two very different beliefs, that the trait humans have of viewing themselves as good is still present no matter the circumstances. After looking at the pattern between these two social change time periods we can then look to other dates in history and search for that same pattern. In addition, we can use this information to predict things in the future. Being able to find patterns in specific points in history allows us to look at history as a whole and gain a deeper understanding.  Knowing these patterns of self idealization tend to repeat through history could raise awareness about current challenges society faces. Looking back at history could help future generations understand that the blind spots and bias in favor of thinking one is good/ right are a pretty natural pattern, but not necessarily an accurate representation of reality.
?The species Homo sapien is different from all other species because of our unique development, both cognitively and physically. The first of three unique attributes of humans is our ability to use fire to cook and defend ourselves from other creatures. Through cooking, Sapiens were able to develop smaller digestive tracts than other species and develop larger brains. This is seen in the text Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, when it touches on how cooking changed human life, By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens. (Horari, 13). With the appearance of cooking, Sapiens were able to decrease their intestines need for energy; giving way to the development of their larger brains. Cooking is one thing that sets Sapiens apart from the world. However, Sapiens werent the only species in the genus Homo who used cooking, rather they were the only ones that developed extreme cognitive abilities due to it. The second attribute of Sapiens that sets them apart from all other species is their cognitive abilities and their language. The genus Homo used fire to cook, and that set them apart from other genuses, it allowed them to enlarge their brains and become more effective foragers. The application was vast, but the only species in the Homo genus that from this enlarged brain, developed an ability to form deep social connections and customs was the Sapiens. After the cognitive revolution, the Sapiens began to form larger tribes than what was once possible, growing to about 150 humans in one tribe. The Sapiens did this through their development of language, they could gossip about everyone in their tribe and by doing so know who everyone was. Their ability to form groups of over 150 individuals took more than simple gossip, it took a collective conscious, the ability to bond over a system of common beliefs or a culture allowed for more vast cooperation between Sapiens. This is seen when the book Sapiens describes the reason behind humans vast cooperation, The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. (Harari, 27). Hunting spirits, gods, demons, etc. all allowed for humans to ban together through beliefs and the ability to see and create outcomes in their minds made Sapiens truly unique. Finally, the way Sapiens expanded our knowledge demonstrated the creativity and resourcefulness of the species Sapiens. Trade was a way to move import and export necessary materials from one place to another, it gave way for inlanders to have things found only in the oceans and those from the coast to have things that were only found inland. The rise of trade gave rise to the passing of goods, but it also gave rise to the exchange of information. Merchants could pass language, tradition, and culture throughout countries and even continents through trade. By exchanging information in trade Sapiens were able to expand their intelligence and create and innovate. While it is unsure what a human is, the species Homo Sapien is set apart from the world by their cooking, speaking and thinking, and trading.?How was Christianity religion shaped by the environment in which it was formed? 
Luisa Grutz-Bianchi

As Christianity developed it became increasingly adaptable to the changes Rome caused in its environment.  
Judaism was a location-based religion, as a result of this dependency on physical locations when things were destroyed it deeply affected the religion. The temple of Soloman was an extremely holy place to the Jewish peoples, it was the location in which they worshiped god and was the physical location of god. In the year 138ce, the temple of Soloman was burned to the ground because of the conflict between Romans and Zealots (religious extremists). This caused Jesuss supporters to decide that Judaism needed to be reformed; but how could they do that? Since the Zealots were fighting with the Romans, and the Romans were not good at distinguishing between religions, the people who wanted to reform Judaism needed to do so fast. They stopped physically circumcising themselves and changed to the metaphorical circumcision of the heart. They also made new holidays. Over time, Christianity became a religion based on the heart and mind. This allowed it to spread much faster because it was easier to practice. In contrast, Judaism was not seeking new followers in the same way. These differences between the two were assisting in the separation of the two religions. 
Another example of how overtime Christianity became more adaptable to changes is when Rome was burnt to the ground. In the year 410ce Rome caught fire. This was worrisome to the Christan people because the majority of them lived in Rome. Because Christianity is a religion of the heart and mind they begun tell one another that there is a City of God. In the City of God, everything is good and beautiful. This adaptation allowed them to accept these changes and continue to grow. 
In conclusion, in the beginning, it was a location-based religion and overtime it adapted into a religion that was spiritual. Christianity had adapted to be a religion where you did not need to be anywhere to specific practice it because it was within your mind.  Many different factors lead to this change, but the biggest one was the Roman Empire. As a result of the Romans destroying things and burning, Christianity had no choice but to adapt to these new environments. From changing their holidays to new ways of worshiping, Christianity is the way it is today because of itss always-changing surroundings.  
?Both Buddhism and Taoism have a goal of reaching a form of spiritual enlightenment, but the way enlightenment can be reached differs between the two religions.  
One of the main similarities between Buddhism and Taoism is that they both seek to achieve enlightenment. When reading the Dhammapada, a Buddhist text, there are clear things that can be done to reach enlightenment and end suffering. Just as a storm throws down a weak tree, so does Mara overpower the man who lives for the pursuit of pleasures, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in eating, indolent, and dissipated (Dhammapada). This quote is telling readers that Mara, the evil deity whos goal is to lead people away from the path of enlightenment, can overpower people who dont let go from distractions and desires. This is similar to Taoism because one of the main principles in Taoism is to go with the flow, Taoism actually can be translated into the way. If we continue to dissect the meaning of what the way means we can examen the following quote. A yellow horse and a black cow make three (Chuangtzu). This quote shows how everything is unified and can flow together, and that can be directly connected to the concept of letting go which is present in Buddhism as well. Another quote from Tao-te Ching, which is Taoist, is Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound, But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. (Tao-te Ching). This is similar to Buddhist concepts because it also states that in order to achieve spiritual enlightenment one needs to let go of the distractions and desires.  
	A difference between Taoism and Buddhism is that Taoism tells you to let go but does not give clear directions on how to do that and Buddhism provides a clear pathway to enlightenment. In Taoism the way cannot be described, it is a broad topic. When reading the Chuangtzu, some of the language is confusing, for example, How would I know that? said Wang Ni. Do you know that you don't know it? How would I know that?Then do things know nothing? (Chuangtzu) When reading this people might become confused, but what Taoism is telling them in this is that they need to go with the way and not feel the need to give an exact definition to it. In contrast, Buddhism has specific lists of how one can achieve enlightenment. An example of this is from the Ten Cardinal Precepts, 1. Not to kill, but to cherish all life.
2. Not to take what is not given, but to respect the things of others. (Ten Cardinal Precepts) This is providing specific steps on how to achieve spiritual enlightenment and how to follow in the path of the buddha. If we compare the Taoist and Buddhist quotes above we can conclude that although they both seek enlightenment, the historical writings on what enlightenment is and how one can achieve that are different in the way they are explained. 
	In conclusion, although some aspects of Taoism and Buddhism have a similar philosophically bend, there are also clear differences between the two. Taoism tells its worshipers to let go but does not tell them how because the pathway to letting go and flowing with the way can not be described, it has to be found. While Buddhism also tells its followers to let go of distraction and desire but lists out ways one can do that to end suffering. In other words, both Buddhism and Taoism say that having a sense of self-awareness will lead to ones suffering, but if you let that go and all other things you are attached to you can reach enlightenment.

Maria Teresa's Path to the Revolution
The book In the Time of the Butterflies by Julia Alvarez follows the development of the four non-fictional Mirabal sisters as they grow from adolescence to their death in their adulthood. People in the Domincan Republic see the sisters as symbols of resistance, and specifically feminist resistance because of their involvment in the recalcitrant movement against the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo. During the time of the revolution, three of the sisters formed the revolution group the Movement of the Fourteenth of June. The book follows one of the sisters, Maria Teresa, also known by her nickname Mate, as she grows up surrounded by revolutionary influences and follows her older sister Minerva to the university. Later in the book, she meets a revolutionary named Leandro whom she falls in love with, and who prompts her to join the revolution. Her actions then lead the government to send her to jail, and later she is killed in a targeted government ambush along with her sisters Patria and Minerva. Three of the reasons that lead to Mates joining the revolution in the Domincan Republic are to pursue her love interest Leandro, the desire to protect her sister and to follow her, and to give her a purpose and an outlet for her energy.
One of the main impetuses that leads to Mates joining the revolution is her love interests (Leandro) being involved in the revolution. Mate wants to join the revolution because she knows it will give her an opportunity and will bring her closer to Leandro, a member of the revolution. She also feels that in order to be worthy of Leandro she needs to join the revolution and sacrifice her time and safety for a greater cause. Mate writes about her first encounter with Leandro, I didn't know what us he was talking about, but I knew right then and there, I wanted to be part of whatever he was. This shows her captivation with Leandro and her augmented attraction to the revolution now that she is aware of his involvement in it. It also shows her determination in joining the revolution so she can be in the same exclusive group Leandro is in. Her motivation to join the revolution because Leandro is part of it shows how his being involved with the revolution is a reason she joins the movement. She also writes, I don't want to be babied anymore. I want to be worthy of Palomino,(142). This quote shows that Mate believes that she is not good enough for Leandro (nicknamed Palomino) and thinks that joining the revolution will make her worthy of him. Mates want to change herself for Leandro exhibits the fact that she wants to put in effort to try to get to know him. This shows that her need to be worthy of Leandro, a member of the revolution, and the desire to spend time with him, leads Mate to join the revolution. 
Throughout the book, Minerva and Mate are shown to be the closest of all the sisters, which is why Minerva ends up influencing Mate in her decisions and is one of the main reasons Mate joins the revolutionary movement. When Mate is a child, Minerva influences Mate and coerces her to reflect on her life. When Mate and Minerva are older, Mate decides to follow in Minerva's footsteps and go to the university and study to become a lawyer. As common for siblings, the younger sibling looks up to the older sibling for guidance and usually tries to imitate the siblings behavior.  This is why, when Minerva joins the revolution, Mate later joins following her sisters lead. An example of this behavior is where Mate writes in her diary, I argued all up and down, but it was like the time Minerva wanted to do the hunger strike. I said, Minerva, were already half-starved, what more do you want? She held my hands and said, Then do what you think is right, Mate. Of course, I ended up on a hunger strike, too,(236). This shows Mates tendency to follow Minerva's lead, even when it goes against what she believes and is dangerous and physically taxing to her. Joining a revolution, even when she knew that revolutionaries could be jailed, tortured, and killed on the command of the regime, was a high stakes decision that would greatly impact Mates life. Making such an impactful decision would take a lot of positive benefits of being part of the revolution to decide on joining, so Minerva being part of the revolution must have been one of those main reasons. Mate also writes, But what was I supposed to do? Leave Minerva behind to be a martyr all by herself?(236).  This matters because it shows Mates dedication to Minerva's safety and supporting her by exhibiting Mates concern with leaving Minerva in a difficult situation by herself.. Because Mate is so concerned with Minerva's welfare, this shows that Mate not only joined the revolution because Minerva did, she also joined to keep Minerva safe and to support her in her chase of political change. 
A third motivation that Mate had for joining the revolution was to have a purpose and a place she could direct her energy. The book portrays Mate as a very tentative character who often follows the lead of others instead of being self motivated. The book also portrays her as a very male attention and love focused character in her early adult years. Throughout the book Mate searches for the right person who will define her purpose as a romantic partner, and later a wife. This seaching is what leads Mate to join the revolution because she can focus her energy into the movement instead of aimlessly searching for a love interest. Before joining the revolution Mate writes in her diary that, I want to know things I dont even know what they are. But I could be happy without the answers if I had someone to love,(122). This shows that Mate has a desire for knowledge and understanding, and that the energy she puts into pursuing possible love interests is her attempt to try to fill the hole she feels is caused by her lack of comprehension of the world around her. This desire to fill the emptiness she feels leads her to join the revolution because in joining the revolution she can gain the knowledge and understanding she seeks, and can pursue Leandro, the man she is in love with. After joining the revolution, Mate writes, Im a natural for this, really. Ive always liked men, receiving them, paying them attention, listening to what they have to say. Now I can use my talents for the revolution,(143). This shows how now involved in the revolution she is using the energy she put into pursuing romance into the revolutionary movement. By finding a place to use her talents she is able to understand herself and her purpose and also she is able to form an identity for herself instead of using a romantic partner to define her. Throughout the book, Mate searches for a purpose and a person or idea to direct her energy at, this search leads her to join the revolution where she can find a purpose for herself.
Observing the reasons Mate decided to join the revolution in the Dominican Republic, helps us understand the reasons others may have to speak out or make the decision to join a group that has many risks. One of the main reasons Mate joins the revolution is because people she loves are members. For Mate, joining the revolution was an opportunity to get closer to a love interest (Leandro), and to protect and support a loved one (Minerva). Other people in a position similar to Mate might feel obligated to join a group to protect a loved one from getting hurt or making bad decisions, and others may join groups to get closer to some they admire or love. Mate also joins the revolution to feel worthy of love. This might show that people might join groups to feel politically active enough to deem yourself worthy of the love from someone who fights for justice. Studying Mate for reasons why others might speak up or join revolutionary movements is particularly interesting because although Mate disagrees with the actions of Trujillo, the dictator in the Doinican Republic, the main reason she joins the revolution is not because she opposes the regime, unlike her sister Minerva. Especially in books that follow a character in their revolutionary acts and their actions against injustice, the main character is usually motivated by their abhorrence of their political situations, not for other reasons. This brings up the question, is it more compelling and believable if the main character of a story that involves a revolutionary journey, joins the revolution because of their detestation of the government or for other reasons??Mendelian genetics in relation to yeast genes

Geneticists base many of their experiments on Mendels laws. We based our genetics experiment on two of Mendels Laws. First, Mendels law of independent assortment, the idea that two traits will be inherited independently of each other. Second, Mendels laws of segregation, the idea that allele pairs will separate in gamete production and be placed in random gametes. Our research examined two genes in yeast strains, coloration (pink or white), and ability to grow without leucine. We hypothesized that this experiment would support Mendels laws of independent assortment and segregation. We began with two yeast strains, one was pink and could grow without leucine and the other was white and couldnt grow without leucine. We mixed the yeast strains and produced white yeast that could grow without leucine. This indicates a complete dominance pattern for the white and ability to grow without leucine traits. We then looked into what gammetes the yeast would produce and our findings showed a half and half split of both traits with varying combinations. Our findings support our hypothesis because the beginning cross showed Mendels law of independent assortment because each yeast strain had one dominant and one recessive gene, showing two different inheritance patterns for traits, and the gamete observation showed Mendels law of segregation by only yielding spores with one trait (no dual presentation of the same trait was observed).
Introduction
Mendelian genetics are imperative in scientific fields. Gregor Mendel was an Italian scientist who spearheaded genetic fields and research by studying the inheritance patterns of pea plants and developing laws from his findings. We will be discussing how our experiment supports Mendels laws of segregation and independent assortment. Mendels law of independent assortment states that two traits will be inherited independently of each other. Mendels law of segregation states that allele (trait type variations) pairs will

separate in gamete production and be placed in random gametes. To understand how to observe these laws, we must also understand inheritance patterns. In this experiment we only saw complete dominance inheritance patterns, meaning only one gene expression was present in heterozygous (having two different alleles) and homozygous (having the same two alleles) subjects.
In our experiment we observed the inheritance patterns of two traits in yeast, coloration and ability to grow without
leucine. Leucine is an amino acid that yeast use for metabolic functions. Certain yeast strains can grow and reproduce without leucine in their media, this ability to grow without leucine is a heritable trait.
We chose yeast for this experiment because they grow quickly and we are able to extract, grow, and observe the phenotypes of their gametes. Beginning with haploids, organisms (yeast) with one complete set of chromosomes, we can breed two strains to form diploids, organisms (yeast) with two complete sets of chromosomes. These diploids are heterozygous for any traits that the two mated haploid strains did not share.
Starving these diploids will cause them to undergo meiosis, the resulting four spores per diploid are packaged in the parental cell body. These four spores are called tetrads and can be dissected and the gametes (spores) can each be grown into a new yeast colony.
Results
In the first part of the experiment we bred two yeasts, pink yeast that could grow without leucine and white yeast that couldnt grow without leucine. From this cross we placed the F1 on a plate without leucine along with controls and observed the growth of the yeast. All the F1 generation had the same phenotype, white with the ability to
grow without leucine (Figure 3.). This demonstrates that the allele for white coloration is dominant to the allele for pink coloration and the allele for being able to grow without leucine is dominant to the allele for being unable to grow without leucine.
In the second part of the experiment we induced meiosis in the F1 generation and allowed the gametes of eight tetrads to grow. We observed a 1:1 ratio for both traits per tetrad, a fifty-fifty split over all. Sixteen out of thirtytwo were pink, sixteen out of thirtytwo were white, sixteen out of thirtytwo were able to grow without leucine, and sixteen out of thirtytwo were not able to grow without leucine.
Graphs and Figures
Figure 1. P generation yeast
The pink square of yeast is able to grow without leucine and the white square of yeast is not able to grow without leucine. Both the pink and white yeast squares are haploids, meaning each type only has one complete set of chromosomes.
Figure 2. Plate containing growing F1 diploids
We added white yeast that couldn't and pink yeast that could grow without leucine to a plate with media containing leucine and allowed it to grow. The image above shows the yeast while it was growing. We mixed the two yeast strains four times on multiple dishes to have multiple tests.
Figure 3. Plate without leucine in media containing transferred F1 diploids
We transferred the mixed yeast strains to a plate that did not contain leucine in the media to observe whether the yeast would grow. We added controls in the bottom, the two smaller black circles (yeast that could not grow was placed on the one that had a visible - and yeast that could grow on without leucine was placed on the one covered by yeast).

The recorded data (Figure 6.) shows the same number of gametes that grow without leucine and gametes that dont grow without leucine. There is a 1:1 ratio of gametes that grow without leucine to gametes that dont grow without leucine.
Conclusions
Our results showed evidence strongly supportive of Mendels laws. In our first part of the lab, we bred two yeast strains of different phenotypes (one, pink, could grow without leucine and one, white, could not grow without leucine) to determine the inheritance pattern of coloration and necessity of leucine, and to determine if these yeast follow Mendels laws. After breeding them, we let them grow on a
non-leucine and leucine plate. We found that all the offspring were white and could grow without leucine. Because the two original yeast strains were homozygous for each trait, the offspring must be heterozygous. When a heterozygous group of individuals, a colony of yeast, show one phenotype, it indicates a complete dominance pattern of inheritance for whatever trait is presented, in this case white and the ability to grow without leucine are the dominant traits. Our findings support Mendels law of independent assortment because both yeast strains carried one dominant and one recessive trait, meaning that the inheritance pattern of one trait is not linked to another. Additionally, in the second part of our experiment we starved the yeast so they would sporulate (make gametes in the form of tetrads) and we could dissect
their tetrads and grow the gametes to observe the phenotypes of each gamete. We found a 1:1 ratio for pink vs. white and, for ability to grow without leucine vs. not able to grow without leucine. This ratio supports Mendels law of segregation because in heterozygous individuals, each chromosome pair has two variations of alleles for the same trait. Because we saw no dual presentation of a trait in any of the gametes, we can draw that the allele pairs were separated and each gamete has only one allele for the traits. If the alleles split in gamete production, gametes have a 50% chance of getting each allele, so the 1:1 ratio for each trait per tetrad fits this segregation law. Additionally in each tetrad there was no exact distribution of alleles to have a 1:1:1:1 ratio of phenotypes, indicating that there is randomness associated with placement of chromosomes in gametes. We found our hypothesis to be correct because our findings support Mendels laws of segregation and independent assortment.?Alex Angell Brian Crawford English 100

A Reason for revolution In the Time of the Butterflies
Why does someone join a revolution? The 1994 novel In the Time of the Butterflies by Julia Alvarez addresses this question as she follows the lives of four sisters in the Dominican revolution against Rafael Trujillos regime. The book follows the lives of the Mirabal sisters across three decades, as they mature and become national heroes and revolutionary icons in the Dominican Republic. Three sisters, Patria, Minerva, and Maria Teresa (Mate) join the revolution for commitment to both family and god, independence, and love, respectively. The fourth sister, Ded never joins, but lives to tell their story. Patrias path to revolution is indirect. She begins life as the eldest child in a family that enforces conservative religious and cultural views. She grows up with her religion being a strict backbone to her actions and ideals. Patria starts a family at a young age while her two sisters join the revolution. Slowly, the revolution invades her life until she finally joins after a traumatic experience with her church group. After Patria joines, she is able to help coordinate the church and the revolutionaries. Together, the three sisters fight the venal government until they are murdered in a grisly roadside ambush by Rafael Trujillos militia. What this shows is that, of the three sisters, Patria has the strongest connection to the revolution through her commitment to her family and her god.
Patrias family-centred view of the world causes her initial exposure to the revolution. In
the beginning, though she has not joined the revolution, two of her sisters have become involved
in the struggle. Her affiliation with the revolution at first stems from the love and worry she feels for her revolutionary sisters. Though she supports the cause, she doesnt want her family to be in danger. After she decides to name her baby after a revolutionary, she muses about her worries for her familys safety, I was running scared. Not for myself but for those I loved. My sisters - Minerva, Mate - I was sick sometimes with fear for them, (151). This shows her connection to the revolution isnt based on personal views, rather the fear of her sisters being in danger. She is scared for her sisters safety because she knows how Trujillo deals with revolutionaries such as them; torture and murder. As a family-loving person, Patria puts extraordinary value in her sisters and their children, so when Minerva requests to have Patria take care of Minervas six-month-old baby, Patria is appalled at the strain and emotional toll of the revolution. The depth of the revolution in her sisters life impacts her with the fear of losing them; if they die, they are dead, but they leave behind their family to miss them. The revolution comes further into her life when she offers her sisters,  a place to meet, and so I offered them our land. (156). By offering her land for their revolutionary meetings, Patria puts her family in danger. Though she can tell the Servicio de Inteligencia Militar (SIM, the Military intelligence service) that she and her husband, Pedrito, are unaware of them being there, it is a gamble if they would believe it and if they would punish them anyway. As such, the first steps she takes in the revolution are jeopardizing her family, one of the things she holds dearest.
After her sisters join the revolution, her son Nelson wants to join. Patria is hesitant to
allow Nelson to go to the capital to join the revolution because she worries for his safety as the government continues efforts to crush it. Though she wants to protect him, she knows she cant stop him. Instead, she thinks, of a way for Nelson to be in the capital, under supervision so he
wouldnt be running wild with women or his rebel uncles. (152). The revolution has infiltrated another layer of her personal life when her son joins, someone even closer than her sisters, especially because she has already lost one of her children. The worry for her son in the revolution brings her even closer to the cause because she can no longer ignore the Domincan Republic's problems with her son spouting news of chaos from the capital. Later, Patria invites her sisters and other revolutionaries inside her home. Pedrito is angry because he worries about being left bereft of their possessions if the government finds out. As he exclaims to Patria, You crazy, mujer, to invite them into the house! You want your sons to lose their patrimony, is that what you want? (165). After Patria tells Pedrito that Nelson does not want the farm, Pedrito joins the revolution as well. Patrias familial relation to the revolution goes deeper than that of her sisters because both her son and husband have joined. She loves her whole family, and most are part of the revolution.
Patrias reason for joining the revolution speaks to the core of her moral foundation. As a
woman of God, Patria is devout and dedicated to the church. Whenever Patria is dealing with grief or family issues, she turns to her god for solace. Her personal religious experience of the Virgencita solidifies her connection to her religion, and when she is worried about her sisters and son she seeks solace in prayer. Religion is woven into her being, and it is a fundamental part of her identity. The final motivation for Patria to join the revolution is centered around religion. She goes on a retreat with her church group and the surrounding mountains are shelled while she is in the church. She saw the wonder on [a young boys] face as the life drained out of him, and I thought, Oh my God, hes one of mine! [...] I cried all the way down that mountain. I looked out the spider-webbed window of that bullet-riddled car at brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, one and
all, my human family. (162). Though the boy that dies is not one of her own children, she feels connected to him through God. Her obligation to help and protect others she views as family from Trujillos regime drives her to the revolution. She prays on the ride down the mountain, but in her prayer is a vow to not allow her family to suffer. Her religious views change through this vow, to now keep her human family safe in the name of God. Additionally, she compares herself to one of Gods angels when referring to the mood of the room of her next church meeting as being, silent with the fury of avenging angels sharpening their radiance before they strike.
(163). As an angel of God who believes in carrying out the will of her benevolent deity, the complete constant of her life and belief that she lives by, her connection to the revolution is one of belief in self identity. Patria would do anything if she thought God willed it, and as she prays for her family she decides that the Dominican Republic needs a religious revolution. Patrias drive originates from her deep connection to her internal beliefs, making her choice to join the revolution a matter of integrity rather than a matter of choice.
The connection and drive Patria has in the revolution is common across different types of revolutionaries. Familial connections to causes can strengthen our drive because we are more empathetic to those we are close to. However, internal impetus is often stronger than external drive. When people are directly impacted by an issue and their identity, seen by others or themselves, is put into the crosshairs of an idea they will develop a stronger connection and drive. You can often identify peoples motivations by observing their delivery. For Patria, it is her family and religion that drive her, so she combines the power of her church with the power of the revolutionaries. Identity and relationships are complicated, but often we can see a person's drive by what they prioritize.?What differentiates homo sapiens from other humanoids? Essentially, what does it mean to be human? 
I think that the main difference between homo sapiens and other humanoids is that homo sapiens are social, community seeking, and storytelling creatures. 
The need to have communities and social interactions is a part of homo sapiens DNA, during times when we were accompanied by many other animals that fell under the genus homo, this trait proved itself to be a key component in our survival.
 Hunting is much harder when you are alone, but when there are many people communicating about what should be done next makes the task much easier. Neanderthals usually hunted alone or in small groups. Sapiens, on the other hand, developed techniques that relied on cooperation (Harari, 36) Another quote that provides evidence to support the concept that our need for social interactions was so useful states, In a one-on-one brawl, a Neandthral would probably have beaten the Sapiens. But in a conflict of hundreds, the Neanderthals wouldn't stand a chance. (Harari, 36) These quotes show that unlike many of the other humanoids, homo sapiens had the ability to work together. Homosapiens were not the strongest or the biggest, but since they could cooperate effectively in large groups and adapt to challenges quickly and effectively, homo sapiens survived when the other humanoids, like the Cathedrals, faced extinction. 
The ability to tell stories comes from our unique language. Not only were we the first animal to develop a complex language, but to a scientist's knowledge, we still remain the only animal to possess this important ability. A green monkey can yell to its comrades, Careful! A lion!But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a heard of bison. She can describe the exact location, including different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they should approach the river, chase away the lion and hunt the bison. (Harari, 22) Language gave homo sapiens the ability to communicate in-depth and then plan what should be done to address what was stated. The advanced language lead to stronger bonds between homo sapiens to be formed which ultimately leads to more success when hunting, trading, etc. This ability to speak about fiction is the most unique feature of the Sapiens language.(Harari, 24) Another unique part of the Sapiens language is that they can tell stories. Storys build trust, form bonds, lead to teamwork between homo sapiens. All of this leads to the survival of homo sapiens.
In conclusion, I think that what differentiates homo sapiens from other humonids is their ability to work together, communicate, and to tell stories. If, for example we found out that rats could do all these things, I probably would not think of them as humans, I assume that most people would agree with me. This is because of the bias that I grew up with when I think human, I see a friend, parent, teacher, of movie star. I dont see a rat. But I think that if other animals developed the abilities that would classify their intelligence as humans, secoity as a whole would need to change the way they see the world, and how they answer, what does it mean to be human.

Showing vs. Telling in Relation to Description, Imagery, and Theme in Short Stories 
Have you ever written a story that focuses on a specific character, and had the experience of thinking that your character sounds and acts nothing like a real person does, after reading your writing? This is because replicating human behavior in writing is really hard. Creating a character that acts like a real human being, involves understanding how the characters actions will be perceived by a reader. Writers must not only convince the reader that their character acts like a human being, but also create a relationship between the character and the reader that is similar to relationships the reader could have with another human. One way an author can do this, is by showing a characters emotions instead of directly telling the reader how the character feels. Showing a reader how a character feels is where the writer hints at a character's emotions by describing their actions, word choice, or body language, among other things. Showing makes the reader infer the emotions of a character by piecing together intimations the writer gives them. As opposed to telling, where the writer tells the reader how the characters feel, by describing the emotions they feel to the reader. A literature genre that often uses the technique of showing instead of telling, is short stories. Short stories often focus on showing character development or make a point about human character, so the technique of showing instead of telling is important to creating the intended relationship between the reader and the characters in short stories. Two stories that contain good examples of how showing instead of telling can be implemented this way are: The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, and Thank You, Maam by Langston Hughes. These short stories are prime examples of how showing instead of telling can be implemented to hint at a character's emotions. In these short stories, and in other literary pieces, the effects of showing instead of telling can be created in many different ways. A main way the technique can be implemented is with the description of a character's body language. This essay will explore how description can be used to execute the technique of showing instead of telling.
One tool that writers use to show how a character is feeling and hint at what they are thinking about is describing a character's body language. As humans, individuals learn how to read each other's body language to navigate social interactions. And although people may mostly do this subconsciously, the hints of a person's feelings gathered from observation of body language add up to a cursory understanding of their overall emotions. When a description of a character's body language is added to a piece of writing, the reader can read the character's body language like they would with a real human being. And especially since certain actions are directly correlated with specific emotions, sometimes a single mention of body language can clue the reader in onto the emotions of the character. This type of description is used in the story The Lottery. The story says, The people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions: most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around,(Jackson 5). This quote utilizes the description of body language to hint at how the people in the story are feeling by describing that the people are not engaging with others and licking their lips. The behaviors described in the quote leads the reader to believe that the characters are nervous. Since the action of licking your lips is either associated with eating, or as a habit of nervousness, the reader can use their deduction skills to infer that the characters are nervous. This quote also mentions the people being quiet and not looking around, and those behaviors show that the characters are not interacting with the other people around them. And since humans closing themselves off to others is an act of nervousness, this description of body language only hints further at the fact that the people are nervous. Earlier on in the same story the people's body language is mentioned as well. An example of this is in this quote, They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed,(Jackson 2). Just like the other quote, the description of the people's body language hints to the reader that the people in the story are feeling negative emotions. In the previous quote, the body language uses showed that the people were nervous, and in this quote the description hints at the fact that they are uncomfortable, especially with the situation they're in. In the story The Lottery, the stones are used as part of a truculent murder, and so in preperation, people of the village gather stones in a pile. The description of how the people are distancing themselves is symbolic of the people distancing themselves from the murder the stones are involved in. And the other description of body language in the quote is the illustration that the people are telling jokes quietly, and smiling but not laughing. This description contrasts with the other description of the people's body language. Since the people distancing themselves shows they are uncomfortable with the situation, but smiling and telling jokes are generally associated with lightheartedness. The combinations of these opposing emotions hints at the peoples inner turmoil. The people in the story are uncomfortable, since you wouldn't distance yourself from something you're comfortable with, but since they are telling jokes and smiling they are also trying to hide that they feel uncomfortable. By making jokes and smiling, the people described in the quote are trying to signal that nothing is wrong to others and themselves. But their body language betrays the fact that they are uncomfortable. Because the people's jokes are quiet and they aren't able to laugh at the jokes, only smile, this hints at the reader that they actually aren't actually having fun, it's a facade. A third example of body language being described to hint at a character's emotions and thought process, can be found in the story Thank You, Maam. The story states, The woman did not watch the boy to see if he was going to run now, nor did she watch her purse which she left behind her on the day-bed. But the boy took care to sit on the far side of the room where he thought she could easily see him out of the corner of her eye, if she wanted to,(Hughes 3). This quote describes the body language of a boy that hints at what the boy is thinking. Because in this quote the boy chooses to position himself in the room away from the purse, and where the woman can see him, the reader understands that the boy wants the woman to think hes trustworthy. The woman gives the boy a chance to steal her purse, and instead of stealing it, he makes himself visible to her, signaling to her that he won't steal the purse, and also giving her an opportunity to see him being honorable. This description of body language and its meaning also show how the boy thinks of the woman. Because he wants her to see him as trustworthy, that means he respects her, and wants to get her respect. Just like from that description of body language, what the reader can conclude from the hints they receive, can not only tell readers the emotions of the characters, but can help them understand the motivations and thought processes behind the characters actions. And when the reader understands the story in this way, they will have a more complex view of the characters journey, and the story will gain new layers of meaning.
The technique of showing instead of telling can be implemented in many different ways, and in coordination with not only description, but other literary literary devices as well. But how does showing affect the way the reader perceives the characters and the story as a whole? Showing is more effective at creating a relationship between the reader and the character than telling is. This is because showing prompts the reader to infer what the characters emotions are which requires a more active reading style. Whereas with telling, the reader is directly told how a character feels, so they only have to passively absorb the information about the character. When the reader is only passively reading about the character they may become tepid about the character's journey and the story. Also, since the reader does not have to use their observation skills and inference while reading, the reader puts in less energy to understand the characters emotions, and thus may not have as much of a strong sense of empathy towards the character. But if when showing a character's emotions instead of telling, the author does not hint enough at the emotions being experienced, the reader may become confused with the characters actions and not understand the story as well. However, if there are enough hints about the characters emotional state, then showing is more effective than telling. An author should use showing instead of telling when they want to create a strong relationship between the reader and a character or characters. Showing is effective at this since, by making the reader become scrupulous while reading, and spend mental energy on figuring out the character's emotions, the reader has more of an investment in, and a bond with the character. And that bond, coupled with the reader's more complex understanding of the characters emotions caused by showing instead of telling, creates a strong relationship between the reader and the character. And that strong relationship can also go hand in hand with the reader developing empathy for the character in some stories. In stories where the author wants the reader to feel bad for a character, or to relate to the character's situation, the author may use showing to stir the reader's empathy. Having the reader experience empathy for a character or characters, not only strengthens the reader's relationship to the character, but enforces the involvement a reader has in the story. Empathy formed through the act of showing instead of telling makes a reader's experience of reading a story more deep, and builds their empathy for all humans, not only fictional ones.

Bully
	Jamie, I presume you know why you're here, correct? He looked right at Jamie and they locked eye contact.
	Yes Principal Christoferson. Jamie looked away and turned to look at her mother's dry, magenta lips.
	What you have said to your classmate is very serious, do you understand why?
	Yes. Jamie's lips were pressed together, her face was solemn.
		What made you say something to Celia?
	I dunno. Jamie mumbled, still looking down. Jamie's mom jumped in.
	Yes, why did you? Celias so nice. She turned to Principal Christoferson, Jamie has been moody in the past month, she might have just been having a bad day. Jamie continued to stare at her left shoe. 
		So Jamie, were you having a bad day?
	I dunno. Jamie squirmed in her seat.
	Did anyone make you bully Celia, Jamie? There are other students that harass her.
	I dunno. Jamie's mom flashed a forced smile at the principal and turned to Jamie. 
	Honey, stop saying that.
No.  Jamie remembered what had happened perfectly. It had only happened a week ago. She pressed her lips tighter. After the principal paused he addressed Jamie. 
How about we take a break. 
Thank you, Jamie's mother smiled at the principal and reached her hand over to Jamies chair. 
Jamie walked down the quiet hallway with her mother a few steps behind her. The hallway smelled like stale popcorn, stale but still salty with a hint of butter. Jamie paused to look at a poster about Joan of Arc. Her mother at the bathroom door looked back at Jamie. Jamie could feel her mother watching her but kept her attention directed at the poster for a few more seconds. She turned at the girls bathroom, hesitated, and opened the door. Once the door was shut Jamie's mom started talking. Jamie, try to be more expressive. You dont want a suspension on your record, right? Especially so close to graduation. 
Yeah. Jamie said her voice in a hard and steady tone. Before her mom started a new sentence, Jamie ducked into the nearest stall. After sitting down, Jamie let out a breath. Before she could think, she was remembering the incident.
Jamie sat alone, the Ziploc bag of baby carrots the only thing left of her lunch. Jamie thought about eating the carrots, but before she could decide someone sat down at her table.
Hey Jamie. Jamie looked up and her eyes widened for a second.  I im sorry about what Jaden said about your new hair. Even though it is a boys haircut, I think it looks nice. Jaime scuffed the floor below her bench. Jamie? Did you hear me?
Yes.
Umm okay?
What do you want?
 Umm, you could say thank you. I gave you a compliment. The table was silent. Celia waited a second and stood up. I was just trying to be nice, I thought maybe we could be friends since Jamie didnt know what came over her, but she stood up. Her nails pressed into her hands, her palm was wet and warm, the red crescent impressions would last for hours.
Were not similar! It came out strong and loud. Everyone in the cafeteria was looking. You dont understand! Well never be friends, I dont want to be friends with someone like you. You deserve to be bullied!
Jamie's mom knocked on the stall door.
Honey, we should be getting back to the principal's office. Jamie opened her eyes and stood up. After leaving the stall Jamie went to the sink, keeping her eyes on the floor till he got there. She turned on the faucet and stuck her left hand under the soap dispenser. Pink, shiny and pearlescent, cherry scented soap pooled in the middle of her hand reflecting and distorting the lights above. Jamie's mother reached over and ruffled her hair through Jamie's soft, short hair. I miss your long hair, it was so pretty on you. You've changed a lot in the past month. Jamie compressed the soggy brown paper towel into a ball and threw it in the trash. Her hand smelled of the soap, staining her skin with scent.
	They walked back down the hallway and back into the principal's office.
	Did you think about what I have asked you Jamie?
	Yes.
	Do you know why you did it?
	I was having a bad day, she upset me.
	Jamie, I understand having a bad day, but taking your anger out on someone else is not the right way to deal with one. Jamie's nails cut into her arm, leaving red half moons in her uncomfortable skin.
	I know. I regretted what I said right after.
Okay. The principal leaned back in his chair. I have decided not to suspend you. 
Thank you so much Principal. Jamie's mother's lips were stretched across her face, her coffee stained teeth contrasting with her bright fuchsia lipstick color. But Jamie, no more incidents like this Also, you are going to have to do some things before we can forget about this matter. You will write a letter to Celia and his parents, realizing what he had said he corrected himself a second later, her parents. There was a pause where Jamie's mother uncrossed and recrossed her legs and no one else moved. The principal continued, You will also have lunch with the school counselor twice a week until the end of the school year. Do you have any questions?
No. Jamie looked straight at him for a second then averted her eyes. He addressed Jamie's mom.
I need you to sign a few papers, give me a second to fill them out. While she waited, Jamie's eyes wandered around the principal's office. Her mother kept glancing at the principal or Jamie. Jamie studied a dark brown mask from another culture on his wall. The holes for the eyes were tiny and the mask had small painted lines all over the face. It was made from a coconut husk, it had little brown hairs sticking up on the wood like outside. Her mom and the principal were done. Jamie's mother stood up and looked at Jamie.
Thank you Principal Christoferson. He nodded. Jamie stood up and took one last look at the mask, then left with her mom.
?The Renaissance was the time of revitalization of classical ideas from Greece and Rome.  People were beginning to think for themselves and started to believe that they (man) were the center of their universe.  It was the era of embracing education, science, and the arts.  After the Renaissance, the Reformation followed.  Soon people began questioning the church and the people who held power.  Martin Luther was a primary figure in the protestant reformation who did not agree with the ideas of the Renaissance.  He spread his ideas and ended up getting people to read and interpret the Bible for themselves.  The Renaissance and the Reformation are all about new perspectives and attempting to define humanism. 
During the Renaissance, man is the measure of the universe.  God had always been the basis for everything.  The common belief of the time is that God is the reason why everything happens.  Originally, no one questioned the church, but people began wondering if there was a God.  If there was no God, how do the priests have power if their power comes from God?  The Renaissance was all about being able to question things and be skeptical.  They valued education and art; teaching people to be individuals.  Art is representative of the time and what society is going through.  Renaissance art was no longer ashamed to portray the (male) human body.  It was incredibly detailed and portrayed genitalia.  It shows that they thought humans were beautiful and that their actions were significant.  Man became the ultimate representation of God. 
The Reformation soon followed the Renaissance.  This was the time of reforming the church.  Martin Luther was an influential figure during this era.  He believed the Bible was the central source of religious authority, leading to people reading and interpreting the Bible on their own.  He also believed that the church was corrupted and you should not buy indulgences -reduced punishment after death, but instead, have faith.  Luther wrote 95 theses essentially saying that the Bible was the center of religious authority and that you cannot buy indulgences.  His ideas spread through the printing press and he influenced a lot of people to question the church.  This led to uprisings that eventually created new branches (protestant church) of the Catholic church.  Martin Luther hated the renaissances view of humanism but still believed that people should be educated and be able to form their own conscious decisions.
The Renaissance and the Reformation was a period of education and questioning revealed truth.  Even though they both had the same aspect of skepticism and learning, their views of humanism were the opposite.  The Renaissance believed that humans should be appreciated and that man is the measure.  The Reformation believed that the human nature is corrupted with sin.  All in all, without the Renaissance and the Reformation, Europe would not be the place that it is today.?My feet echoed empty sounds as I trotted around mothers opulent home. I had been home all day again, but the time was productive; I went on a run and honed my tree climbing skills after receiving gibe from the local baddies. Now, my stomach rumbles and my mouth waters, the fabled treat of cream that mother tries to keep from me filling my mind. I crouched down as I slowly approached the land of the forbidden, the kitchen. With its hardwood floors, my steps had to be meticulous; sound would alert the guardian. I stalked the silver appliance that held my greatest desire, the flavor of joy, the feeling of pure bliss. As I finally reached the silver ice chest, I let out a sigh, the tension flowing out of my joints. A small victory. Beginning to claw at the box of destiny I could almost taste that sweet relief of my favorite frozen treat. However, when I felt the looming presence of the gatekeeper, I froze.
Molly, stop clawing at the freezer. The great beast of the kitchen had detected me and rushed me off to the pedestal of the table. My head fell as my bones grew heavy, the treat I desires leaving my reach. This is the fifth time in two days! I told you to stop, that stuff is bad for you. Sitting in my chair I bark a response, as always, falling on deaf ears. I didnt expect it to work, me and mother live in totally different worlds, she never understands me or my valiant struggle. I suppose I shall have to wait until she leaves it unguarded and use my wit to swipe the creamy treat. Until then, I retreat to the comfort of my bed, dreaming of the sweet creamy flavor on my tongue, remaining ever vigilant for when I find another opening.?Ketchup Donuts

History
1/17/20
Many aspects of todays society have been influenced by Rome. You can predict where our society is heading based on past events and patterns that occur throughout history.  We learn from the past, then take that knowledge and apply it to situations.  It can be used to steer society away from going down that path or help it get ahead.  For example, the dominant religion in todays culture is Christianity which came from Rome.  During war, people try to recreate Hannibals attack hoping to have the same victory.  The study of Rome has influenced many aspects of todays culture and has also predicted the direction of where our society is heading; based on the patterns of Romes history. 
	Language has the power to neutralize violence or start violence. Mark Anthonys speech (44 BCE) is an example of an event that caused civil unrest just by having a persuasive argument.  He flipped the all the things Brutus said about Caeser and made it so that it would no longer target Caeser, but Brutus.  His speech convinced the people who were originally against Caeser that Caeser actually did good things.  Later on in history (1920), Hitler had the same situation.  He had a persuasive speech that appealed to his audience and convinced them that the Jews were the cause of all their problems.  The pattern of someone having a convincing speech with the intention of causing civil unrest, neutralizing violence, or starting violence occurs frequently throughout history.  You can probably expect that a lot of these types of events will be prominent in the future because of all the new ideals of society today.
	When you appeal to the masses ( normally the poor/ middle class) it usually means that they were trying to gain power.  The Gracchi Brothers were rich men who tried to create social reforms.  They try to give the people more votes and give the poor land.  To the Romans, it sounded like they were trying to become kings.  During elections, candidates running for power try to appeal to their audience.  Some may look unkempt to seem more humane and relatable such as Boris Johnson.  They make promises that the people would want to hear to get their vote.  
	Historical events of Rome widely shape and predict the direction our culture is heading.  It is important to study the history of Rome because you want to take these examples and apply them so you dont make the same mistakes.?The study of Rome teaches us about how people will follow historical trends. Staring with the mythic period, a time of kings, tyrants, and Roman legends, Rome begins its governmental trends. This period ended around 509 BCE when Tarquinius XX is assassinated by Brutus because of his cruel ruling. Brutus says, Sic semper tyrannis. (Notes), meaning dust or death to all tyrants, before killing Tarquinius. From that death, the Roman republic is born. This moment is looked upon with honour by most people as it was the end of an autocracy that oppressed many people. The moment was celebrated and from then on in Rome, if someone was getting popular and ignoring the greater prosperity of the kingdom, they would be killed for acting like a king. 
This rule was carried on through history for about five hundred years causing the deaths of both kings and people the senate didnt like. From 143 BCE to 63 BCE the Grachi Brothers became popular with their stances in politics; they gave more votes and gave land from the rich to the poor. Once again, the senate decided to kill them because they were acting like kings not good rulers. One brother died of fernature and the other was forced to comit suicide. Following the Grachi brothers, around 63 BCE, the Triumvirate involving Crassus, Pomppy, and Julius Cesar was formed. Julius was growing popular with the people of Rome, winning wars, territory, and riches for the empire. When Crassus died and Julius began to sleep with Cleopatra, a queen, Pomppy began to doubt Julius with a little coercion from his fellow senators. Julius was seen as a king by the senate for being ambitious and sleeping with a queen. He was killed by a descendant of Brutus and twenty two other senators because they didnt want one to get to much glory. The assassins also said Sic sempur tyrannis (Notes) when killing Julius because he was acting like a king.
 Finally, this instance happened again about two thousand years later, in the assasionation of U.S. President Lincoln. The assassin said, once again, Sic sempur tyrannis (Notes) before killing the man, doing so because he viewed Lincolns actions to be comparable to that of a king. Rome has repeated itself many times before, but what is important about this is when we can predict current events based on the past. Studying Rome gives us the ability to follow historical trends and begin to understand the flow of history within empires.?Hinduism vs. Daoism

In religions with goals focusing on community good  it is easier to rule, in religions focusing on communal good, it is easier to rule.
Basement of goals to benefit. Who benefits from the goals?
Religions based in communal good will often have an outside force to drive them into their practices whereas religions based in personal good are practiced through a force of personal drive.
Religions interact with their goals differently, but many of the goals fall into two categories of communal good and personal good.
We said, "Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. (Surah). Guided by power.
And to man He said, "Because you listened to your wife, and you ate from the tree from which I commanded you saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed be the ground for your sake; with toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life. (Genesis). Punishment for all because one didnt obey.
The great man regards Heaven and Earth and the myriad things as one body. He regards the world as one family and the country as one person. (fore.yale.edu, Sacred Texts). One as whole - filial piety 
I have a sense of shame before the Way and its Virtue, and for that reason I do not venture to raise myself up in deeds of benevolence and righteousness, or to lower myself in deluded and perverse practices. (The Complete Works Of Chuang Tzu). balance within oneself. 
Upon his death, he told his disciples: Be ye lamps unto yourselves. (Buddhism Religious Basics). Death of the Buddha does not marked by return or new leader - you to you - dahlilamma helps not rules
Whether practicing, appeasing a deity, or finding personal peace,is the goal, religions have overarching goals that everyone in the community strives for. Religions interact with their goals differently, but many of the goals fall into two categories of communal good and personal good. Judaism is a prime example of a religion focusing on communal good. Stories follow a pattern of god giving an order, people not obeying, then being punished, feeling sorry, and god forgiving. This story form gives obeyal center stage. If the people had obeyed god, nothing bad would have happened. In the story of Adam and Eve, god gives the order to not eat from the tree of good and evil. The humans are tricked into doing it and for their disobeyal, god says, Because you listened to your wife, and you ate from the tree from which I commanded you saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed be the ground for your sake; with toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life. (Genesis). In this story all humans are punished for Adam and Eve disobeying god. The goal of obedience to please a deity is common through multiple religions, and is centered in communal good. In Judaism, following gods orders reduces punishment. In Christianity, waiting for Jesus and following his ideals makes the world kinder because Jesus focused on helping the less fortunate and being a generally good person. In another example of a religion with the goal of communal good, Confucianism bases itself in a hierarchical system. Unlike Judaism and Christianity, Confucianism doesnt have one god to appease, it has rules that must be followed for a harmonious society. A master of Confucianism said, The great man regards Heaven and Earth and the myriad things as one body. He regards the world as one family and the country as one person. (fore.yale.edu, Sacred Texts). This ideal unity of people shows the focus of confucianism on everyone staying in their place to keep harmony. Rather than a god to appease, the religion is focused on communal stability, looking to the past for guidance.
Though multiple religions focus on communal good, many also focus on personal good. In contrast with Christianity and Judaism, Islams goal of obeyal is more focused on personal good. The idea of appeasing god isnt for the whole community but the individual. As god said, "And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. (Surah). The decree of obeyal to guidance is not referring to salvation for an entire group, rather it is for the individual who chooses to follow. Though the goal of obeyal and pleasing a deity is prominent in this religion, people do it for their own good. Additionally, religions that are relatively godless, or dont have a set belief on what or if god is, also have goals that feed into personal good. In Buddhism, the goal is to reach enlightenment and become a Buddha. This goal is personal to the practitioner of Buddhism, it is not for the purpose of helping others, but oneself. Before the Buddha died he told his disciples, Be ye lamps unto yourselves. (Buddhism Religious Basics). The Buddhas advice was not to cast radiance onto others but to find it in oneself. The idea of finding ones path to harmony in oneself is shared in Taoism, too. The personal venture to find fulfilment in life is shared through Buddhism and Taoism, yet they function differently from each other in how to get there. Finally, Hinduism is a religion with the main goal set to moksha, getting out of samsara, the cycle of rebirth. The goal can be achieved through following ones dharma, purpose and place in life, and accumulating karma that will increase their status in the next life. The system puts a society in order because everyone is born as one thing and follows it until they die, but the goal is for each individual person to reach moksha. 
Religions that are similar in beliefs and goals are very different from each other or very similar depending on the purpose of goals, and religions that are vastly different in beliefs and goals can be very similar to each other or very different depending on the purpose. ?The three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, have all similarly shaped societies today to be inherently misogynistic and oppressive of women. This is portrayed in the texts from each religion, like the Quran and the Bible, and how women are represented and treated in each. United States societies today are heavily influenced by Christianity, just how societies in the middle east are dependant on Islam. The sexism shown in these religions has caused societies influenced by them to oppress women and treat them as nothing more than objects and property. 
In the US, where, in 2016, Christians made up more than 70% of the religious population, there have been strict rules set for only women that oppress them in society. Until 1920, women were not allowed to vote. Women could not have their own names on their passports until 1937. They were not allowed to sue for sexual harassment until 1977, and until 2013, women were not allowed to serve in combat. Oppression of women is not an issue of the past in the United States, and it can certainly be traced back to the objectification of women in the Bible. For example, many times Eve is not referred to by name but simply and his wife, [...] the man and his wife, but they were not ashamed. In this verse (verse 25, chapter 2), Eve is simply shown as the wife of Adam and nothing more. This theme is shown even today as a womans only role being a wife, not a woman capable of working and making her own decisions. Later when Eve eats the forbidden fruit God tells her "I shall surely increase your sorrow and your pregnancy; in pain you shall bear children. And to your husband will be your desire, and he will rule over you." (verse 16, chapter 3). This explicitly states that Adam, the man, rules over Eve and is in charge of her. This sets up all societies that are influenced by this text to, consciously or unconsciously, internalize these gender roles and create laws around them, no matter how ridiculous they might seem. There is no logical reason that a woman should be able to speak up for what she believes in, whether this may be to vote or protect herself, but these laws have been created after years upon years of internalizing these gender roles. 
In a Surah of the Quran entitled The Women, a womens place in society is shown. This chapter sets up laws for both men and women to follow. In verse 34 it states Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. This verse states that women are mere property of there husbands, and their jobs are to be obedient and mind their husbands. This is an extremely problematic way to view women, though, throughout history, has been widely followed. In fact, in Saudi Arabia, where more than 90% of the population is Muslim, women were only recently allowed to travel alone. As of August 2019, women in Saudi Arabia were allowed to travel without their husbands or a male escort, as well as being able to drive and attend sporting events. Though in the US women are allowed to do all these things and more, it is a huge breakthrough for the women of Saudi Arabia. After spending years of injustice only because they were born female, this small right is finally granted to them. This society that follows what the Quran has laid out has neglected to fully think about the unjust rules it entails. A woman should not be kept from traveling alone, yet the rules state that her husband, the man in charge of her, must go as well. 
Since American societies nowadays are shaped by Judeo-Christian laws, and many countries, especially in the Middle East and parts of Africa and mainly Muslim societies, the three Abrahamic religions are fueling sexism within many societies around the world today. Women are barred from doing even the simplest of tasks, only because they are female. The three Abrahamic religions have many similarities in the sense that they have rules that punish women for being women and create incredible injustices to the females in each society. A woman should not be punished and oppressed because of her sex, something that she did not choose, but, more importantly, should not be ashamed of just because her society and religion tell her to be.

?Report on conditions at prison, La 40.
The conditions in La 40 are abysmal at best. The guards lack clemency when dealing with prisoners and the culinary care of the prisoners is remiss. The prisoners look slim and they hardly have the energy to plod around their cells, many only look to the window. Their health is putting prisoners in jeopardy of many illnesses. Additionally, the guards of La 40 harass prisoners in attempts to coerce them into doing deeds for the government. Though we are unaware of the composition of such cruelty, the prisoners were able to show us a few visible bruises and broken teeth in the interviews. The prisoners did not talk to us much, but thanks to a young lady at another prison we ascertained more information on the activities taking place there, though she gave us no personal account. La 40s prison system was being sold to us by the guards in the guise of a humane prison, but from the actions taken by the guards to hand pick prisoners, and the behavior of the prisoners, we are given intimations of a venal system that holds a punitive nature of function. Though we cannot allow the guards and government run rampant and continue on this belligerent path towards prisoners, we must be wary in our approach to a possible red area.?
In the Time of the Butterflies is a fictional story based on real events on 4 sisters grow up under the rule of a ruthful dictator named Rafael Trujillo. They end up forming an underground revolution to combat and restore order to the Dominican republic. Mate is one of the 4 Mirabal sisters who ofter looks up to Minerva, one of the other sisters and often times doing things just to please others because of herself. Throughout the book, she seems to feel conscious of what others think of her and makes an effort to please others, even if it means dropping everything she has been working for the revolution.
After palomino delivers the shipment of guns which first showed Minerva and Manolo were in the movement it raises some confusion for Mate and they explain everything to her about it. I wanted to join. I could feel my breath coming short with the excitement of it all. But I masked it in front of Minerva. I was afraid shed get all protective and say that I could be just as useful sewing bandages to put in the supply boxes to be buried in the mountants. (142) Before Mate encountered Palomino delivering the gun shipments to the Mirabal house she had no prior understanding of the underground revolution and Minervas connections to it. The evidence seems to suggest that because Minerva is in the revolution and she also sees Minerva as an older sister, she wants to prove to her especially that she is more than capable to participate in the revolution, and not stay behind the lines doing handiwork. Through the book, she seems to have a strong motive to prove things to people, and self-conscious of what other people might think of her. In the evidence, this happens when she wants to hide her excitement in front of Minerva, and again with Palomino.I dont want to be babied anymore. I want to be worthy of palomino. Suddenly, all the boys Ive known with soft hands and easy lives seem like the pretty dolls Ive outgrown and passed on to Minou The evidence suggests how she wants to be worthy of palomino by then again trying to prove to herself that to be Worthy of him she would have to participate in the revolution as much as she could. Even though Mate creates this image in her head where she needs to do this for Palominos approval, her anxiety is what causes her to join the revolution and be a big part of it. Without looking for Palominos approval and proving she is just as capable of Minerva This instance would have turned out way differently, and most likely would rather not join the revolution, or be way less involved than she is now. I think this because to start her only motivation to want to be really involved in the revolution was I was afraid  shed get all protective and say that I could be just as useful sewing bandages to put in the supplies boxes to be buried in the mountains.(142)  If she was not so worried about Minervas opinion, she would have been just as happy being behind the lines.
While Mate writes in her contraband Jornal, Minerva is being dragged into solitary confinement by guards because she was speaking out about the revolution and her own free will  As she was being marched down the hall, a voice from one of the cells they passed called out, Mariposa does not belong to herself alone. She belongs to Quisqueya! Then everyone was beating on the bars, calling out,viva la Mariposa! Tears came to my eyes. Something big and powerful spread its wings inside me. Courage, I told myself. And this time, I felt it. What the evidence suggests is how this experience impacted Mate more than anyone else. This is because having a sister like Minerva speaking out and rebelling against the government even in solitary shows how she feels courage for the movement because she is often seen wanting to be like others and want to impress them. Something big and powerful spread its wings inside me. Courage.(238) This means more to her than others in was such as this being more personal to mate than the other people in the prison. Seeing Minerva, her older sister fights back against the guards and her then feeling courage shows us Minervas influence on mate, especially in a scenario like this.Ive lost all interest in my studies. I just go to classes in order to keep my cover as a second-year architecture student. My true identity is now Mariposa (#2), waiting daily, hourly, for communications from up north  (143) The evidence shows how Maria Teresa is more devoted to the revolution, even by dropping her studies for the revolution which she has been working at for 2 years. It shows how her own thoughts on what other people thought of her influenced her to the point where she drops the things she had been working for a long time because by dropping all her studies we can see that she is devoting her life to the revolution by dropping all the studies she has worked very hard on.  
I started to shake and moan, and call out to mama to take me home.
Thank God, Minerva saw in time what was going on. She crawled into my bunk and help me, taking soft and remindful to me all the things I had to live and be patient for. I settled down. Thank god. (231)  The evidence shows how in this example and in many other examples Minerva has always acted as an older, responsible, and caring person who looks aways looks after her sisters and an almost perfect individual to Mate an example of this would be  Minerva says its better letting yourself go, not that she ever does. (231) implying how she might be envious of how Minerva can deal with problems better than mate, and we can also see that when the word her  is in italics, this shows us some key reasons why Minerva has such a strong influence on Mate because being prisoners can take a huge toll on the brain and having a sister there to talk to and having someone who struggles with you can be really big. It also shows another reason for Mate to be self-conscious about how Minerva especially thinks about her because she is seen as this loving, compassionate, and fear-free person which at times mate envies and therefore needs to prove to herself she can be more like her. In other instances, seem This can be tied too how she was so eager to join the revelation for the sole purpose of what would be assumed to be her want to impress and/or show she can be like Minerva, brave, having courage, and standing up for what she believes in. This also would be to show herself and prove to herself. (God, it seems like Ill always have a Minerva by my side being a better person than I am.) This This  Minervas influence on Mate, thinking Minerva is better than herself.
	From what we can see how Mate relies on other peoples feeling for her and its eventual backfiring this raises some questions. How would mate feel around people who dont appreciate her or like her? Would she try overly hard? Maby having a huge sense of anxiety over it? This also makes me wonder how much she thought through joining the revolution, did she consider how much farther down the rabbit hole she would go? What would be her breaking point where she said: no more, Im out. Would she even have one as long as there was anyone around left to judge her?

Figure 1. % frequency of shell thicknesses in populations of periwinkle snails.
Frequency of shell thickness of a population of periwinkle snails before European green crabs were introduced (1871), and after they were introduced (1982). Shell thickness as measured by a shell thickness index; population of 40 periwinkle snails in 1871; population of 36 periwinkle snails in 1982. (Adapted from Robin Seeley.)
The introduction of non-native species into ecosystems has various effects on the native populations. Our research evaluated the shell thickness of a population of periwinkle snails before the introduction of European green crabs (1871), and after the introduction of European green crabs (1982). We hypothesized that following the introduction of European green crabs to the ecosystem of Appledore Island, Maine, periwinkle snail shells would become thicker because of the selective pressure placed on them through green crab predation. 40 shell samples from 1871 and 36 shell samples from 1982 (both sample ranges were collected from the same beach) were collected and measured for thickness by Dr. Robin Seeley. Examining the data from Seeleys study, we calculated the percent frequency of shell thicknesses (as measured by shell thickness index) in the given populations and compared them to review changes in the attribute. We found that over time, the periwinkle snails developed thicker shells. In 1871, shell thickness ranged from 2 to 13 with shell thickness of 8 being the most frequently observed in the population. In 1982 shell thickness ranged from 9 to 18 with shell thicknesses of 14 and 15 being most frequently observed in the population. These findings support our hypothesis that, following the introduction of European green crabs to the ecosystem, periwinkle snails would evolve to grow thicker shells. A probable cause of the periwinkle snails shift from thin shells to thick shells is predation by green crabs. This provides a selective pressure by
creating an environment where snails with thicker shells are more likely to survive and reproduce and snails with thinner shells are more likely to be eaten. The evolution of the periwinkle snail population is an example of how the introduction of non-native species in an ecosystem often causes other species to evolve to better suit the new conditions of their environment.?Someone once told me, A story without symbols is like a cake without icing. (Brian Crawford, 2019). Symbolism is a key component in stories, it is a part of the representation of a story and gives life to a created world. Using objects, elements, nature, etc. to represent pieces in a story gives authors the ability to show the characters as the grow and change within their given environment. Recognisable through repetition, appearance in important moments, and experience within culture, symbols are a vital part of a story. Symbols can be used to represent a plethora of things and can be used in many contexts. The author Gal Faye uses many symbols in his 2016 novel, Small Country, as he follows the protagonist Gabriel through pre and mid-war Bujumbura. As the ten year old boy deals with his Rwandan mother and French father divorcing, an ever-complicating social life, and the dangers of the war and genocide knocking at his front gate, symbolic measures are taken to follow his growth into identity. Symbols are used in Small Country to follow the growth of Gabriel (Gaby) as he faces the painful reality of growing up. 
Gaby goes through many mental and emotional changes throughout the book. These changes are symbolized by natural elements and important objects. The first symbol of change, or rather, of something that will change, is mangoes. Each time Gabriel is reflecting on, or experiencing an event relating to his childhood, there will be mangoes present. The first time mangoes are referenced is in a scene describing the dailey shenanigans of him and his friends; fishing, peeing in rivers, etc. with the focus being on their mango picking and selling. Hanging out with one's friends and goofing off is a very childish activity and this immaturity is shown when they are trying to get to the Von Gotzens mangoes and are blocked by the wall around their garden. Back on home turf, we had our eyes on the big, fat juicy mangoes hanging in the Von Gotzens garden. (58). They want the mangoes that are just out of reach; the ones blocked by the wall of the Von Gotzens garden; the mangoes that symbolize the highest level of immaturity are out of reach of the gang. The Von Gotzens are very racist and eventually it is extreme racism that destabilizes the government, allowing us to infer that the wall that is blocking Gaby from mangoes, a happy childhood, is the racism that will soon rip him from his haven of innocents and short-lived childhood. Mangoes are then seen once again in both the rising and falling of a scene in which the enemy of the Kinyanera Boyz, Francis, attempts to drown Gaby and his best friend, Gino. The band of boys sneaks into Franciss garden to steal mangoes, but Gino and Gaby are caught and Francis attempts to drown them in the dirty river; only stopping when Gino lets out that his mother is dead. Both Gaby and Gino are torn up about this, Gaby because he cares for his friends, and Gino because his mother is still dead. Gaby then goes back to Franciss house to retrieve their mango-picking rods that were dropped, I picked up our rods and left the mangoes behind. Nobody would collect them now. [...] I couldnt have cared less about those mangoes rotting on the fresh grass. (106).  In spite of the fear of Francis, who has shown that he would harm Gaby, Gaby returns to get the rods back, presumably to pick more mangoes some other day. However, he lets the mangoes that he did pick rot, just as his innocence and immaturity is beginning to. He never gets the mangoes and so, loses a part of his childhood as he never goes mango picking again. Water was also a major part of this scene, as Francis was drowning them. Water often plays a role in major moments of change with mangoes. The act of attempt at drowning by Francis could be considered as a false, or impure baptism as in religious ceremonies baptism is a form of rebirth through cleansing. However, the water of the river is dirty, showing the impurity that it gives rather than the rebirth. This was a pivotal moment for Gaby as it is the first time he had experienced real violence. 
Water and mangoes are seen once again in a scene just before he is fully definistrated out of his childhood. After Gaby and Gino are nearly drowned, Gino bonds with Francis over their dead mothers, going as far as to include him in their group. When Gino informs that Francis is in, Francis takes the gang to a school just outside Bujumbura in the war zone to swim. In the taxi, the story references the road, saying, Mango trees laden with fruit adorned the main road, chausse Prince Louis Rwagasore. Gino tooted the horn when we spotted some kids from another neighborhood picking off mangoes with their long rods. (126). The trees with fruit and the young boys picking it was Gabys last glance at the childhood that had rotted way, as the mangoes he left behind did. This is also supported by the following scene when Gaby and friends go swimming. Gaby jumps off the high-dive just before they are shooed away by an adult and is extolled by his friends for his bravery. They then all run, in their birth-day suits (129), to the taxi and leave. They wore what they had on the day they were born. Gabys childhood is over now, he left behind the mangoes and got reborn through the water. This rebirth into maturity is then shown once again in a scene after Gaby and his friends are split, like the African rift they are located on, because of differing political views. After the war picks up in Burundi and the start of the genocide in Rawanda, Gaby spends time with an old Greek woman named madame Economopolus who he used to scam. She teaches him the value of books and he soon learns to love books as a way to travel to other places. He had lost much of his hope but she gave him some, and he learned to value that relationship. Later, Gaby meets up with his friends again and finds out that they had stolen Madame Economopoloss telescope. He is maddened by this and tells them to give it back. His old friends retort, You conned the Greek lady, too. That was before! And anyway, its not the same with mangoes I tried to grab hold of the telescope, but Gino pushed me backward. (152). The mangoes or his innocence were different to steal and con because they were something he thought he wouldnt mind getting rid of. It was before he lost the innocence the mangoes represented by letting them rot and found that he missed that ease. He learned the value of things he cares for and to hold onto them if he wants them to stay around. Gaby enjoys the books and relationship madame Economopolus gives him because the books give him hope; hope of living past the war. The telescope is used to see the stars and sky, often things associated with freedom and accomplishment, and represents the hope that he fears to lose by harming madame Economopolus. He now knows the value of mundane things because of what he has lost, and what he wants back. In addition, telescopes are used to see things clearly. Gaby now identifies stealing is wrong; he reflected back on himself. After his friends tell him they wont give the telescope back, Gaby tries to take it by force. He latches onto it in an effort to get it back, symbolizing he understands that hope is a commodity; and one he isnt willing to let go of.
As a final homage to his childhood and his wish to, make a fortress of my [Gabys] happiness and a chapel of my innocence. (159), Gaby writes a letter to his penpal Laure. Directly following Gaby killing a man, he writes to Laure a letter filled with white. The letter consistently repeats the line, Its been snowing for days and nights over Bujumbura. (174). It doesnt snow in Bujumbura. Water is present in moments of change and moments of pain; snow is frozen water. He is torn up about what he was forced to do and now doesnt know how to feel. What Gaby is referencing is something his father said to him before, which he writes in a letter to his deceased cousin, Christian. My father told me that on the day men stop waging war on one another, it will snow over the tropics. (161). The repeated line is similar to the expression of hell will freeze over before [something]. Hell is freezing over, but the war in Bujumbura is far from over and Gaby is still surrounded by bloodshed. Prior to the letter to Laure, Gaby was forced to kill a man; he had to light a car, drenched in gasoline, on fire and burn the man alive. The man was a hutu who killed one of Gabys friend's father; he committed a sin and got burned alive for it, then it snows over Bujumbura. The hell Gaby is in freezes over and he wants it to mean the end of the war. In addition, Gaby writes in the letter, Street children are decorating pine trees with red, yellow, and green, mangoes. (174). He has lost the last of his childhood and innocence after being forced to kill the hutu man. He has lost it all and now writes that the world is upside-down with the tropics freezing over before the war is over.  He wants peace as the doves and white flags in his letter fly over Bujumbura. Gaby fills his writing with white, the only non-white things are the mangoes that he writes. White is often a symbol of purity and he has lost his. He was filled with horror from his mother's stories of his dead cousins, he wished his mother away, he killed a man. The letter is filled with what he wants. He wants his innocence and his childhood from the mangoes; he wants the war to end and his hell to freeze over, to have snowfall over the tropics; he wants the purity he lost when he burned the hutu. 
The use of symbols throughout Small Country is intentional and precise to go along with Gabys growth out of childhood and into his identity. The symbols provide an engaging element and a deeper level to the writing, as a mechanism for proof of construct. Using symbols as a way of following the characters and their internal struggles is an effective way to write character traits and existence. To use symbol in this way gives characters dynamics and depth.
He uses them to show Gabys internal and emotional states, and the feelings, states, and struggles of external factors and how they relate.
Gal Faye uses natural and physical symbols in Small Country to show the conditions and perspective changes of characters. characters change and conflict. 
Maturity and innocence - Mangoes, telescope, water
The characters change (Gaby). His maturity impacts the course of the story and provides identifiable change in his relationships as both he and his friends change.

Wind whipped around her face and in her hair, the whistling of the night sky ran through her head as her form flew up and up. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the view, another mind, another body, another sky. The world was torn up but she didnt feel the splitting feeling in her head, it felt nice, warm even, to be in another time. 
The crackling fireplace roared with vigor as it ate up the wood of the forest trees. Ellie felt safe here, on a plush couch with someone she loved. She didnt see the girl that she was holding and being held by, just the fire burning away at the wood. The fire was drenched in red and the arms around Ellie were gone in an instant. Her heart sank and the warmth that had surrounded her became an icy prison. On hands and knees she tried to push herself up, but heavy laid in her body and bones, paralized by a droplet of honey. The girl with pink hair and rabbit ears came into her vision but it was cloudy with scarlet. Bloody tears ran down the tawny face but none of the words could be heard through the rustle of leaves and a snapping branch.
Help me. A whisper yelled in Ellies ear as the branch under her feet snapped in two. Falling felt different that flight, it was scarier, it was colder, it was death. Though, flying is scary, the difference is you choose to fly, falling is abrupt and cruel. 
I picked up our rods and left the mangoes behind. Nobody would collect them now. [...] I couldnt have cared less about those mangoes rotting on the fresh grass. (106). Right after being nearly drowned by Francis and finding out that Ginos mother is dead and seeing him cry, Gaby goes back for the rods to pick mangoes so he could get more someday, and retrieve his innocence (the mangoes), but he left the mangoes that they were going to steal before to rot in the grass, never to be retrieved, similar to how Gaby will never get back that innocence and immaturity that he once had. 
Whenever I suggested going fishing, or a river trip or mango picking, everyone told me to get lost: they were kids games and we were too old for them now. (137). He let the mangoes rot and he never went mango picking again. His friend told him they were kids games and they left behind their childhood in favor of the war.
You conned the Greek lady, too. That was before! And anyway, its not the same with mangoes I tried to grab hold of the telescope, but Gino pushed me backward. (152). The mangoes or his innocence were different to steal and con because they were something he would let go of but the telescope is used to see the stars, it belongs to madame Economopolus who gave him and escape and hope through books; he has to hold onto hope lest he fall into depression because of the war. He also now identifies stealing is wrong, after losing the mangoes he gains hope but this commodity is one he won't let go.
Maturity and innocence are recurring themes in Small Country and are shown through symbols that are solid versus those that will wither away. Mangoes are a symbol of innocence and immaturity, used to show Gabriels growth as he lets go of his childish ideals. The telescope is used as a symbol of maturity and hope and is used to show Gabriels growth from entitlement to hope and his refusal to let go of the things he has learned to be thankful for.
Conflict and pain - fire, zippo, horse
The conflict that is shown through symbols gives focus to the internal and root problems of the country without cutting out Gabriels struggle. These symbols are often referencing religious things. 
A giant inferno rose up in the sky, licking the uppermost branches of the kapok trees. (172). The hutu called the horse called the devil is burned alive, the devil burns in hellfire.
I tossed the Zippo and the car caught fire. (172). The Zippo was used to set that car with the hutu (devil) in it ablaze as a symbol for racism creating hell for the people and burning people to the ground. 
The devil. Ahead of us, in the darkness, just beyond the beam of the headlights, we saw a shadow of a black horse pass by. The horse is called the devil for scaring the taxi driver. 
In the very same spot where we had glimpsed the beast's shadow on one stormy night, he now lay on the ground, his legs smashed , his body streaked with bloodied wounds. (170). In the same spot the horse is called devil, it is being tortured for being owned by a racist woman. It did nothing wrong but the devil is killed. 
The man in the taxi was a horse that was almost dead. (172). The horse is the devil and the man is one of a group members (Armonds) fathers killers and he is a hutu, the horse, the hutu, the man is the devil waiting to be killed.
False purity/want - horse, white
Symbols that are natural are often used after and during intense scenes as a way of speculation to the pain and acceptance of those hurt
In the very same spot where we had glimpsed the beast's shadow on one stormy night, he now lay on the ground, his legs smashed , his body streaked with bloodied wounds. (170). In the same spot the horse is called devil, it is being tortured for being owned by a racist woman. It did nothing wrong but the devil is killed. 
(174-175). He references white in many ways, the most prominent bing snow but it doesnt snow in Bujumbura the white and snow is the purity and peace that he wishes for. After killing someone he slows life down and tries to purify it by freezing water and scattering it over his life.
Its been snowing for days and nights over Bujumbura. (174). Snow is frozen water. It doesnt snow in bujumbura meaning that this is something that he is referencing as a cleanser to himself after killing the hutu.
Mangoes - symbol of innocence and/or immaturity
Back on home turf, we had our eyes on the big, fat juicy mangoes hanging in the Von Gotzens garden. (58). This line referenced a time when Gaby and the gang go mango picking and they want the mangoes that are just out of reach; the ones blocked by the wall of the Von Gotzens garden. The Von Gotzens are racist sadists and the mangoes that symbolize the highest level of immaturity are out of reach of the gang.
Our hands were sticky and black, our smiles broad and our hearts sugary. Ours was the well-earned rest of the mango-pickers. (60). This shows entitlement, speaking as if they deserved rest for doing little.
I picked up our rods and left the mangoes behind. Nobody would collect them now. [...] I couldnt have cared less about those mangoes rotting on the fresh grass. (106). Right after being nearly drowned by Francis and finding out that Ginos mother is dead and seeing him cry, Gaby goes back for the rods to pick mangoes so he could get more someday, and retrieve his innocence (the mangoes), but he left the mangoes that they were going to steal before to rot ing the grass, never to be retrieved, similar to how Gaby will never get back that innocence and immaturity that he once had. 
(126)
Whenever I suggested going fishing, or a river trip or mango picking, everyone told me to get lost: they were kids games and we were too old for them now. (137). He let the mangoes rot and he never went mango picking again. His friend told him they were kids games and they left behind their childhood in favor of the war.
Water - cleansing 
Its been snowing for days and nights over Bujumbura. (174). Snow is frozen water. It doesnt snow in bujumbura meaning that this is something that he is referencing as a cleanser to himself after killing the hutu.
White - false purity 
(174-175). He references white in many ways, the most prominent bing snow but it doesnt snow in Bujumbura the white and snow is the purity and peace that he wishes for. After killing someone he slows life down and tries to purify it by freezing water and scattering it over his life.
Fire - hell fire 
A giant inferno rose up in the sky, licking the uppermost branches of the kapok trees. (172). The hutu called the horse called the devil is burned alive, the devil burns in hellfire.
Zippo lighter - racism that sets things ablaze
I tossed the Zippo and the car caught fire. (172). The Zippo was used to set that car with the hutu (devil) in it ablaze as a symbol for racism creating hell for the people and burning people to the ground. 
Black horse - the scape-goat for anger (false devil)
The devil. Ahead of us, in the darkness, just beyond the beam of the headlights, we saw a shadow of a black horse pass by. The horse is called the devil for scaring the taxi driver. 
In the very same spot where we had glimpsed the beast's shadow on one stormy night, he now lay on the ground, his legs smashed , his body streaked with bloodied wounds. (170). In the same spot the horse is called devil, it is being tortured for being owned by a racist woman. It did nothing wrong but the devil is killed. 
The man in the taxi was a horse that was almost dead. (172). The horse is the devil and the man is one of a group members (Armonds) fathers killers and he is a hutu, the horse, the hutu, the man is the devil waiting to be killed.
Telescope - hope, stars, greek myths 
You conned the Greek lady, too. That was before! And anyway, its not the same with mangoes I tried to grab hold of the telescope, but Gino pushed me backward. (152). The mangoes or his innocence were different to steal and con because they were something he would let go of but the telescope is used to see the stars, it belongs to madame Economopolus who gave him and escape and hope through books; he has to hold onto hope lest he fall into depression because of the war. He also now identifies stealing is wrong, after losing the mangoes he gains hope but this commodity is one he won't let go.
Books - knowledge, power, escape ?

Answer one of the following prompts. 
1. Has farming been good or bad for humanity? 
2. Were hunter/gatherers more or less violent than agricultural groups?
Violence, slavery, lower quality of life, deasese, lack of diverse diet
Farming has been bad for humanity because it has decreased quality of life. Farming made people more prone to violence because rather than simply fighting over a resource that may be found elsewhere, people had their land to fight for. Land had to be protected because the land that a group lived on was where they had built their permanent settlements and were they had gone through the trouble of growing their crops. Losing land meant losing all the groups hard work in building and farming, but it also could mean losing their lives from starvation. With something so important to fight for human tribes would battle for land. In Sapiens, it states, The early farmers were at least as violent as their forager ancestors, if not more so. Farmers had more possessions and needed land for planting. (Harari, 81). Violence surged through the agricultural revolution, humans killing each other for a bit of land to plant for their own. But, what they were fighting so hard to protect wasnt protecting them in return. Or even supporting them as they support it.
Farming forced people to stay in the same places permanently so they could support their crops. Staying in the same place for long periods of time, eventually becoming forever, led to the easy affliction and spread of diseases. The spread of disease became easy and common in small permanent villages; tight spaces and lack of adept technology made sure of it. The population was able to boom with the development of farming but at the cost of cramped space and an unfulfilling diet. This is seen in Sapiens when the author describes the impacts of wheat farming, stating that, the oasis supported a large but cramped village of 1,000 people, who suffered from disease and malnourishment. (Harari, 83). The cramped spaces within villages of 1,000 were breeding grounds for disease and without the proper immune system development, children were subjected to the brunt of the attack. Children of the villages suffered greatly from the development of farming. When humans were hunter gatherers, children were burdens that would slow down the group. So, in response to that, women had children only every three to four years. They would breastfeed their children for longer, along with other methods, to avoid unwanted pregnancy. However, when farming villages were established children became less of a burden and more of a necessity because of the hard work that it took to farm crops. Women, in turn, didnt breastfeed their children for as long, because they had more of them and children could be fed with cereals. Without the milk of their mothers,  immune systems weakened and humans, especially children, were more susceptible to illness. 
The cultivation of domesticated foods also led to a denial of diversity in humans diet. People were more susceptible to famine and malnourishment because they became nearly solely reliant on a few species of grain for food. If a harvest for a year ended up dying, so would many people because they wouldnt have any other grains or fruit to harvest or any other animals to hunt. When looking at more elaborate farming techniques, Sapiens discusses the effects of the time consuming work. As more effort was directed towards cereal cultivation, there was less time to gather and hunt wild species. The foragers became farmers. Diversity in humans diet is required to live a full, healthy life. If there isnt the needed diversity, people wont get all the nutrients they need and they will become malnourished. Not all foods could be domesticated so humans slowly weaned off their wild diet, secluding their pallets in domesticated nurishment. 
An increase in violence and disease with a decrease in full nurishment meant a lower quality of life for all humans. To be happy is an important value of life and without it life becomes a sad and desolate existence. Farming degraded humans quality of life and for that, it was bad for humanity.?The environment in which a religion is formed has a deep impact on the practices and beliefs of the people. The three Aberhamic religions are examples of this phenomenon. Judaism was shaped by the central focus of the religion in Israel. The god in Judaism is the god of the Jews, not the god of all and he gifted them their sacred land of Israel, not the whole world. It would make more sense for a religion to have god be for everyone and for their land that was gifted to them by the almighty being to be the entire world, but the central focus holds their beliefs in a tight physical realm. These strong beliefs and practices could be attributed to the focus on the holy land and the temple where god sits. Additionally, when The Roman empire took over Israel, Jewish people had trouble because Rome allowed other religions to be practiced as long as the people also worshiped their gods, but their focused religion allowed the worship of only their god. This became a problem for them as it angered Rome, escalating further after a religious purist named Jesus was born and religious extremists became more prominent. The Roman Empire became angered by the Jewish people because they wouldnt worship their gods and religious extremists, Zealots, tried to fight them out of Israel. The conflict in Israel came to a pause when the Zealots burned the food and Rome allowed many to starve or be crucified before burning the temple and sending Jewish people all across the Roman empire. After their temple was burned, most Jews were lost because the physical nature of the religion was brought into question. If the place where god sits could be burned to the ground, the religion could be destroyed.
After Jews were dispersed all across the Roman Empire, Judaism began to spread, but there were drawbacks that Romans were often on the fence about. The nature of the religion was practiced, it wasnt easy to convert to, and Roman men didnt want to be circumcised. The issue of circumcision came from two places; one, Rome didnt like Jews and they could easily tell who was who by who was circumcised; two, men dont want to. The rise of the branch of Judaism known as Christianity stemmed from these problems. As a nonphysical, faith based religion, it was easy to convert to, it couldnt be destroyed because it was faith not objects, practices, or land, and there wasnt a needed sacrifice. All that was needed to be a Christian was to practice the Gospel, believe Jesus is your lord and savior and will return, and to be a good person. The simplicity of the religion and the difficulty of detection by the Roman Empire led to the wildfire spread. The Roman Empires interference led a physical religion to grow a stem into a nonphysical religion as a mechanism of spread and protection.?The renaissance and reformation were times of conflicting ideas in spite of one leading to the other. The renaissance in Europe was a time of rebirth after the plague, a time for art, literature, and philosophy to flourish. Humanist ideals spread across Europe, but not everyone supported this materialistic embodiment of ideas. Martin Luther was a christian extremist who despised the change brought by the renaissance because he believed the churches pursuit of art and materialistic beauty was causing the corruption of good christians. Ironically, using means of the renaissance, he spread his ideas, challenged the church, and caused another shift to european societal belief after the change of the renaissance. 
The renaissance focused on human beauty, the ability to create, and humans as the ideal. Classical Grecoroman philosophy was studied, and art and literature spread across the continent. With the printing press, ideas could have a physical state and be passed on without change from a game of philosophical telephone. This gave the opportunity for lower class people to read and for more churches to actually own a copy of the bible. It also gave a rise in religious artworks that people, and the church, sought after. 
Martin Luther used humanist literary methods to translate the bible so more people could read it, yet the idea of the church purchasing religious art was detestable to him. The church would allow people to pay for leniency in religious practice, and would tell people they could pay for their dead family to get into heaven. This alone was against god, but rather than using the money to spread practices, the church used it for art, and beautiful architecture. This sinning of the church caused Martin Luther to write his 99 theses calling the church out on its unwholly behavior. He spread his ideals of complete devotion and strict practice along with his writings and the bible. In the end this led to the branching of christianity, including a branch of lutheranism. But, in trying to repair what he saw as damage, Martin Luther allowed many to interpret religion their own way, changing the practice and beliefs of the bible ever since. His reaction to stop the church and specify religion to his beliefs ended up in a rebirth of peoples beliefs after they got to know their religion better. 
Europe was changed by both the renaissance and the reformation, following different ideas, but leading to new systems of belief that clash and overlap. The renaissance was not a full rebirth of Europe nor was the reformation a complete change to the people. The renaissance looked to humans as the measure for greatness and resulted in the progression of philosophy to humanist ideals. Martin Luther translated the bible so that he could write and control religion, setting it back on course to heaven. However, in doing so, he gave rise to a opposite to humanism in people getting their beliefs from a book. But, he also gave rise to a different idea, a combination of people basing their beliefs off a book, yet it was by the way they interpreted it in their own experience. The ideas of the renaissance and the reformation are still important today because people are still thinking about them, trying to understand the change from the depression of the black death to the rebirth of the renaissance to the personalized beliefs of the reformation. This shows us how one event leads to another; history moves in a circle, one thing leading to another, repetition of change and events, and peoples continuing reactions to actions.-------Confidential Information Contained-------
Following is the personal report of Officer Robert Pierson of the Chicago Police Department. Pierson attended the protests that took place during the Democratic National Convention of 1968 under the guise of a yippie protester. A month after the convention ended, Pierson wrote this account of his experiences. 
--------------------
A year before the Democratic National Convention, I was chosen out of my department to infiltrate the protests that were set to happen around the time of the convention. Mayor Daley and the Head of the CPD had received reports stating that many large protest organizations around the country were planning to conduct large scale protests during the DNC of 1968. With the Civil Rights protests and Anti-War demonstrations becoming increasingly prevalent in large cities around the country during the years preceding 1967, it was expected that a protest would be held during the convention. 
When I was selected to participate in the infiltration of the protests, I was assigned the identity of Bob Lavin, a member of a biker gang who worked as a bodyguard among radicals often referred to as yippies. I joined the motorcycle group the Headhunters  for a month before joining a group of yippies in northern Illinois that were planning to stage a festival during the week of the DNC. My objective was to get hired as a bodyguard by one of the well known yippies leaders to better collect information on the plans and hidden ringleaders of the group. I was hired by Jerry Rubin and traveled with him and his friends for 4 months before the DNC. I attended the 3 day protests before leaving the group of yippies I had attended with and returning to the CPD.
 
On the first day of the protests, the yippie leaders along with other organizers led a peaceful march that resulted in the arrests of many of the protesters that had attended and all of the organizers. On the second day, after giving an absurdist speech, Abbie Hoffman, one of the most famous yippie leaders was almost arrested by police. During the second day of the DNC, protesters marched to the Chicago Police Department Headquarters, to retaliate against the arrests from the previous day. Although there were rumors of threatened violence, mainly the burning of the CPD building, the protester stayed peaceful. The protesters were met at the headquarters by a large group of police that arrested and beat many of the participantes. A majority of the protesters involved in the altercation were sent to the hospital to recover along with some reporters that had joined to cover the event but ended up with broken collar bones. On the third day protesters based their plan of action on the results of the DNCs Vietnam War policy vote, and because the delegates agreed to de-escalate the war, the protesters planned a peaceful march to the convention center. Allen Ginsberg, a well known pacifist organizer, had received a permit to be on the grounds of the Convention Center peacefully, and planned to levitate the center with a group of protesters positive energy emitted from their minds. This peaceful and lawful action resulted in the pacifist organizers along with prominent yippie leaders being arrested. In jail many of the protesters called for violence to retaliate against the police and Mayor Daleys attacks on their First Amendment right to gather. The moment the protesters were released a riot was started and chaos erupted around the city's center. No successful arrests of the riot leaders were made, and many of the protesters who were involved fled the city so as to not get caught.
Although I did not support the riot in action, I understood the anger of the protest leaders who had been arrested, day after day, for peacefully protesting. Mayor Daley was right to enforce extreme measures during the riot as they contain and prevent the damage of property, but he should not have arrested or beaten protesters involved in peaceful actions.
Before my assignment, I had always been on the receiving end of protesters' actions as an officer. But during my time among the yippies, I was able to experience the life of a protester.The yippies and other members of organizations like the SDS are passionate about the anti-war movement. The protesters I met were willing to sacrifice many things, sometimes including their own lives, to spread anti-war messages. They believe in their efforts completely. Although I do not agree with the methods and absurdity that many protesters rely on, I have respect for their dedication. 
The protesters hold more power than politicians have believed up until this point. And if the organizers of the recent protests at the DNC had not fought over methods of actions and instead had unified, they would have had an even larger impact on the media and the convention itself. If protesters stay dedicated to their causes and organizations grow in size, and unify around a goal they will inflict change onto this country. When that time comes, I do not know whether the protesters will choose violent or peaceful methods of change. But I do know that the leaders of this country should be wary of the power these radicals hold, and be careful not to give them a cause over which to unify.

Final Thoughts On The 1968 Democratic Convention
I dont believe that gender played much of a role in this democratic convention, in terms of who was listened to. Though, perhaps if there were a larger demographic of women to judge by, we might have seen a clearer distinction - though that in itself, my being the sole woman, is cause enough for alarm. I believe that I am listened to, but only because I work hard to make sure I am. When I was a young lawyer, I began wearing my hats so that I would be taken seriously, and I still find it true that, as a woman, I must put in more effort to be seen and heard. I must never let myself be interrupted. I must be firm in my opinions. And this is a universal experience for women. If I were a man I wouldnt have to work so hard to make sure Im being acknowledged and respected. Especially being a nonviolent activist, I cant use a lot besides my words, so if no one will listen to me it makes for a tough situation. During this convention, I made three speeches. I believe that is the most out of any protester, however, I did not get an interview. I understand that people like Abbie Hoffman may draw more media attention with their radical ideas and actions, but that is not to say that my ideas and actions are not just as -if not more - important. I do understand we only had one reporter, but I would have liked to be interviewed. 
For delegates like Mayor Daley, I do not believe he showed any disparity in his treatment of male and female protesters, demonstrated by the fact that I was the only one who was hospitalized. However, I believe that this says more about Daleys tyranny than his feminism. My most striking experience during the convention was the delegate's frustrating discrepancy between their actions and their words. They claimed they were fighting for the rights of the people, stating time and time again that they were the peoples party, yet they went on to arrest their people and advocate for causes like infrastructure rather than civil rights. I am especially displeased with Mr. Ted Kennedy and his lack of promotion for racial equality. I had expected more from him. 
I believe that these decisions could have changed had more women been in the democratic party. I think that women, more than men, especially white men, can understand the urgency and need for civil rights and laws preventing racist actions. This is because, like Black people, women have also been a group robbed of equal rights and expression. These white men simply do not understand to what degree their privilege affects their careers and their lives. They have never been immediately judged or underestimated simply because of their gender or color. They command the police rather than fear them. Beyond that, I would still like to hear more talk about womens rights brought up in these conversations, though that wasnt the main concern of this democratic convention. 
As for potential leaders within the protesters, I think there were a few. There are people like Abbie Hoffman who possess a quality that just draws people towards them and their words - though, especially in the case of Hoffman, I wish people would resist. Hoffman is an unreliable leader for our protesters. I could not have him in charge for multiple reasons. First, I dont agree with his strategies and sentiments and I believe we would all be arrested, if not worse, if he were our leader. Secondly, I dont believe his loyalties lie in politics. He mentioned several times that he believes the entire government system is corrupt and needs to be dismantled. I believe it is counterproductive to work with someone like him, and that I should align myself with those more committed to making a change within the party itself. Unfortunately, both Bobby Seale and David Dellinger stayed rather quiet throughout our discussions (well - quiet compared to Hoffman and I, which is, admittedly, a rather low bar). While I agree with many of Dellingers opinions, especially those that he shared in his last speech about the democratic partys hypocrisy, he was much too willing to go along with Hoffmans radical plans. I wish Id had more protesters with me that were as devoted to nonviolence as I. I also agree with many of Seales ideals, especially as it relates to social justice, but, as a Black Panther, he was also willing to make our message heard by any means necessary. I find it unnecessary to touch on undercover cop Bob Lavine, as he did nothing more than get us arrested and hospitalized. 
To conclude, though there was no obvious disparity between the treatment of women and men (though, again, hard to tell as I was the only test) I think the democratic party as a whole would have benefited from having more women involved in their party. I believe the entire world would benefit from more involvement from women. I had an interesting time navigating working with Abbie Hoffman, though I didnt have much of a choice as we both emerged as natural leaders of the group, with rather opposing opinions. All in all, I stand by my theory that our protesting party would have been better off if wed continued with more non-violent techniques like speeches and marches. Though this convention definitely did not go as I had planned in terms of police violence and hospitalizations, I am pleased we are on a path to withdraw from Vietnam. Though I wish for complete de-escalation, this was more than I expected from our delegates.  ?On the Convention of Death and the Nature of Life- Abbie Hoffman, 1968
And so the curtains draw to a close on the 1968 Convention of Death. George McGovern emerges victorious, having secured the coveted title of losing presidential candidate. The question Im getting asked now, after the events of the convention, is whether I would consider it a success. Whether or not Im happy with the way things turned out. Its a strange question to ask me, I think. Its impossible for me to say that I am happy with the Convention, because it is an instrument of the very system the Yippie party opposes. What could possibly happen at the convention itself that the Yippies might consider successful? If the delegates suddenly took off all their clothes, cannibalized each other, then detonated the amphitheater, then maybe Id be happy. Maybe then I would call the event a success. As things are though, I cant. Although watching Humphrey face a third humiliating defeat did inspire some glee in my heart, I didnt come to Chicago looking for success in the results of the convention. None of the Yippies did.
I want to end the war, I want freedom and equal treatment for Black Amerikans, I want liberation for all people. Im just not stupid enough to try to achieve these goals by screaming them at politicians who dont care what I have to say. You can read a pig Marx, but it doesnt stop him from stealing all the slop. Pigs will be pigs. You can picket and protest and march all you want, but it wont make the men in power change the fundamental systems that put them there. Change has to come from among the people, from outside the very government that oppresses us. Thats what a lot of people dont understand, even my fellow radicals. Even once a person has come to understand the great social injustices committed by the United States, they still may earnestly believe that that same country can rectify its mistakes. Its this great faith in the pig systems that prevents us from actualizing a revolution. We cannot dismantle our oppression without also dismantling the system that creates it.
Any message of sympathy from the mouth of a murderer is fraudulent. The truth is, the only way our government will tolerate protestors is if it is not afraid of them. And nothing is quite as unintimidating as a bunch of well-mannered people politely asking politicians to consider ending the slaughter in Vietnam. The fact that the pigs do not see protestors as an actual threat to their power and corruption is never to be celebrated as a victory. Those who the pigs do not spend time silencing are generally not saying anything worthwhile in the first place. When the pigs are angry with me, thats when I know Ive succeeded. When Mayor Daley throws a temper tantrum over my mere presence, when he sends his militant police force to beat me up for speaking my mind, thats when I know Ive done my service to the revolution. One of my heroes, Lenny Bruce, was arrested and banned from almost every club on the map for his routines. But when the government goes that far to make sure no one hears your voice, people will begin to wonder what youre saying. People will come to see your shows or watch your demonstrations, and thats what matters.
What I want, above all else, is people looking at me. So I do whatever it takes. I throw money on the New York Stock Exchange, I attempt to levitate the pentagon, I dress up in a prison uniform and chain myself to a post. Because people will look at that. No one wants to look at a protest of respectable people making reasonable demands of their so-called representatives. For the average Amerikan, there is not much difference between self-proclaimed respectable protestors and politicians themselves. Bottom line is, theyre both a snooze. And you can call me a lot of things, but a snooze is not one of them. I believe firmly that protests should not mimic the systems they claim to oppose. A protest should be everything our government is not. A protest should be exciting, a protest should be accessible, a protest should be living and breathing. In Country Joe and The Fishs famous Fish Cheer, they sing Whoopee! Were all
gonna die! Thats what Im all about. If the government insists on being sterile and boring, the revolution must be comical and absurd.
Some people call that opportunism. They say people like me have no real interest in a revolution, or in the liberation of the people. Were just in it for the dope or the music or the fucking, and if we get to burn down a few buildings or smash a few windows thats groovy too. It is true that the appropriation of a revolutionary lifestyle is meaningless without revolutionary philosophies. But a revolutionary consciousness without revolutionary life is equally meaningless. Life in itself is what this country hates the most, so much so that simply existing the way I want to is seen as an act of rebellion. This nation is hell-bent on commodifying the bodies of every man within its borders, on turning people into machines meant only to serve the wealthy and powerful. I live in opposition to this system because I care for my brothers and sisters more than I do for the evil powers that oppress us. Continuing to live as a slave to the Pig Empire is not revolutionary; the revolution is instead contingent on freeing ourselves from learned obedience.
Such a feat is difficult, as we have spent our whole lives training to serve the corrupt imperial USA. The Amerikan government wants to be the father of its people. It raises us to be good little boys and girls who take orders without question, who will always do their daddys dirty work when asked. We the radicals are treated like any rebellious children would be. The government attempts to convince us that our demands are unrealistic and childish. Our concerns are dismissed. We are told not to worry. Our pleas go unanswered. But when we become too disobedient, the Pig Empire cracks its whip. It beats and kills us, and it tells us thats what happens when we question it. Our bloodied bodies are broadcast on television screens to the rest of the children of Amerika. We are a warning of what happens if they step too far out of line.
Eventually though, all children realize their father is a liar. This time is coming for the Amerikan people. These past years of blatant secrecy and manipulation by our government have sparked a mass awakening among the youth. They have realized that the control the Amerikan government claims to exercise over its children is a construct. And when the people cease to believe in imagined power, that power ceases to exist.
In order to achieve such enlightenment, it is absolutely imperative that we disregard any metric of success imposed upon us by Pig systems. If we continue to internalize any of their messaging, we are unable to effectively dismantle their rule. Convincing my fellow protestors of this fundamental truth was the main difficulty I encountered in Chicago. On the second day of the Convention of Death, I was talking to a group of protestors about a sit-in. One of them, Bella Abzug, said to me I cant involve myself in that. She launched into a spiel about how we must not alienate the governmentabout how no one will respect us if we look like lunatics. What I told her, and what I will tell anyone who insists on clinging to the validation or acknowledgment of politicians, is that it is unimportant whether the pigs hold me or any other revolutionary in high esteem. I will take lunacy over surrender any day. I will never compromise my values to better meet the wants and needs of the pigs. I will never attempt to appease them. Because no matter how much we water down our beliefs to make them palatable, no matter how much we mutilate ourselves to look like model citizens, no form of success can ever come from cozying up to our oppressors.?When I read poetry, all of the words seem to form a picture in my mind, and I start to create a world in my imagination of what the poet is describing. Every word is like a pixel in the image in my mind, and sometimes, it changes the more I read. Although, you have to be very careful, because what you could be imagining might not have been what the author was imagining. To truly understand the meaning of a poem, you must understand elements of the authors life, and sometimes if you look close, you can start to see elements of the authors life written in the poem. These are usually in the form of a metaphor or allegory though. Something very interesting about poetry is that you see the world in a new perspective. This is because poetry is empathy. As you step into the shoes of the author while reading their poetry, you start to see the world as they pictured it, and you start to feel what they felt. This, to me, is why poetry is so powerful.?Alex Pichler

Sneaking a Cookie out of the Cookie Jar:
The Consequences of Pursuing Instant Gratification
It is the nature of desire not to be satisfied, and most men live only for the gratification of it. - Aristotle. Gratification, as Aristotle mentioned, is what most people live for, but what Aristotle didnt mention is the difference between instant gratification and delayed gratification. Instant gratification begins with the desire for something tangible, in other words, an earthly desire, that someone wants promptly gratified. For example, someone might have the earthly desire for a cookie, and if they were to pursue instant gratification, they would choose to eat a cookie in that moment to attain immediate satisfaction. However, if this person were to choose to not eat the cookie because they had the intangible desire to be healthy, or in other words, the spiritual desire to be healthy, this would be a form of delayed gratification because the outcome of being healthier is delayed in contrast to the immediate satisfaction of eating the cookie. The decision to not eat the cookie can also be seen as holding a desire in abeyance, in the sense that this person had the self control not to eat the cookie because they knew of the consequences that it would bring. Throughout The Crucible, by Arthur Miller, and The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, we observe the tension between instant and delayed desires, and how they connect to instant and delayed gratification. In both stories, earthly desires are depicted as a form of instant gratification and spiritual desires are depicted as a form of delayed gratification. As we scrutinize some of the characters such as Proctor, Dimmesdale, Hester, Chillingworth, and Parris, we observe patterns between their behavior, and how they are punished. One thing that these characters all have in common is that each of them lacks the self control needed to hold their desires in abeyance, and each chooses to pursue instant gratification to attain immediate satisfaction. From how these characters are punished, the lesson we can learn is that delayed gratification leads to success and reward, while instant gratification leads to failure and consequences.
From the beginning of The Crucible, we learn that Proctor has committed adultery with Abigail. In Christian theology, temptations of the flesh are earthly desires that appeal to carnal and physical appetites which should not to be satisfied. We can observe how the Bible describes temptations of the flesh as desires not to be gratified in Galatians 5:16. Indeed, So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh(Galatians 5:16). Here, the bible says that if you walk by the spirit, you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. Proctors action of succumbing to a desire of the flesh categorizes his affair as instant gratification because he put aside his spiritual desire to satisfy his earthly desire. Throughout the rest of The Crucible, the consequences of his behavior unfolds. First, Proctor feels guilty during his conversation with Elizabeth, for [he] may blush for [his] sin (Miller 58). Here, the word blush refers to Proctors shame. If Proctor didnt feel guilty for his sin, he wouldnt have said that he blushes for his sin at all. We can further see Proctor's internal shame when Elizabeth mentions that The magistrate sits in [Proctors] heart that judges [him] (Miller 52). Here, the magistrate refers to Proctors guilt. Also, when Elizabeth mentions that his guilt sits on his heart judging him, this phrase refers to his guilt causing him internal suffering, a consequence of committing adultery. Something similar to this is in The Scarlet Letter when Dimmesdale internally tortures himself to repent for his sin. This establishes that internal guilt is a consequence of instant gratification. We can also observe how Proctors sin inadvertently causes the Salem witch trials during his conversation with Abigail when Abigail mentions I used to weep for my sins when the wind lifted up my skirts; and blushed for shame because some old Rebecca called me loose. And then you burned my ignorance away (Miller 141). Here, when Abigail mentions that Proctor burned [her] ignorance away, she refers to her affair with Proctor opening her eyes. After Proctor and Abigails affair, everything seemed to take a turn for the worse. Their affair led to Abigail losing her ignorance, which led her to start dancing in the forest with the other girls, which then led to accusations of witchcraft. Therefore, if John Proctor had never committed adultery, the witch trials in The Crucible may never have transpired. Proctors internal shame and the Salem witch trials are consequences (and in a way punishment) for Proctors earthly desire for Abigail's love and his pursuit for the instant gratification of their affair.
In The Crucible, Parris longs for authority and has the earthly desire for power. This desire leads the townspeople to dislike him. The towns dislike appears when the narrator mentions that [Parris] believed he was being persecuted wherever he went, despite his best efforts to win people and God to his side (Hawthorne 3). Here, when the narrator mentions that [Parris] believed he was being persecuted wherever he went, the word persecute refers to the town's dislike of Parris. Furthermore, the use of the phrase wherever he went implies that everybody in the town disliked him. Parris also appears as a villain when the narrator explicitly mentions that [Parris] cut a villainous path, and there is very little good to be said of him (Hawthorne 3). Additionally, when Hale asks Proctor why his third son wasnt baptized, Proctor replies that I like it not that Mr. Parris should lay his hand upon my baby. I see no light of God in that man. Ill not conceal it (Hawthorne 62). Here, Proctor shares with Reverend Hale his dislike for Parris. In the play, Proctor is esteemed, so it makes sense that the rest of the town should share a dislike for Parris with Proctor. From how Parris is disliked by the townspeople for his desire for power, instant gratification is frowned upon and depicted as unholy.
Even from the beginning of The Scarlet Letter, Hester is externally shamed by the townspeople. Indeed, [Hester] has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die. Is there not law for it? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book (Hawthorne 49). Here, the townspeople are disappointed in Hester when they mention that she has brought shame upon us all, implying that Hesters behavior somehow had an effect on them. Furthermore, they despise Hester when they mention that she ought to die, implying that Hesters punitive scarlet letter isnt severe enough. The external shame and alienation Hester faces is a consequence of pursuing instant gratification. Dimmesdale on the other hand deals with extreme internal shame. Indeed, While thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul [] Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office (Hawthorne 123). Here, the black trouble of the soul refers to Dimmesdales internal guilt and suffering. The phrase gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul refers to Dimmesdale being haunted by his guilt. Also, Dimmesdale is once again tempted by earthly desire (the first time being his sin of adultery) after his encounter with Hester in the forest. Indeed, Tempted by a dream of happiness, he had yielded himself with deliberate choice, as he had never done before, to what he knew was deadly sin (Hawthorne 152). Here, Dimmesdale being tempted by the dream of happiness refers to Dimmesdales desire to attain happiness with Hester. When the text mentions that Dimmesdale had yielded himself with deliberate choice [] to what he knew was deadly sin, this portion of the quote shows how Dimmesdales earthly desire leads him to deadly sin. Similar to Proctor, Hester and Dimmesdales affair is a desire of the flesh because they both succumbed to their carnal appetites. Their pursuit for desires of the flesh are forms of instant gratification because they focused on earthly desires instead of spiritual desires. Indeed, Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires(Romans 8:5). If Hester and Dimmesdale would have focused on what their spirits desired instead of what their flesh desired, they probably wouldnt have committed adultery. From how Hester and Dimmesdales behavior is punished by the townspeople, and from the shame they face, instant gratification is something reprehensible and frowned upon. 
In The Scarlet Letter, Chillingworth appears during Hesters pillory. As Hesters  husband, and after discovering that she committed adultery, Chillingworth develops a pure hatred for his adversary (Hesters fellow adulterer). After his meeting with Hester in the prison, he then makes it his mission to ascertain Hesters fellow adulterer and to punish him. Chillingworths desire for revenge is a form of instant gratification because, instead of choosing to suppress his desire for revenge, he pursues it to attain instant satisfaction. As Chillingworth continues to be swallowed by his thirst for revenge, he becomes perpetually dependent on punishing Dimmesdale without clemency. Indeed, the narrator limpidly mentions that as [Chillingworth] proceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though still calm, necessity seized the old man within its gripe, and never set him free again, until he had done all its bidding. He now dug into the poor clergymans heart, like a miner searching for gold (Hawthorne 113). Here, when the text mentions that a necessity seized the old man within its gripe, and never set him free again, this refers to how Chillingworths fascination with internally torturing Dimmesdale turned into a necessity. Furthermore, the text using the metaphor searching for gold further shows the level of obsession that Chillingworth has with Dimmesdales internal guilt. We can see how dependent Chillingworth is on Dimmesdales guilt after Dimmesdale dies on the pillory. Indeed, Nothing was more remarkable than the change which took place, almost immediately after Mr. Dimmesdales demise, in the appearance and demeanour of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth. All his strength and energy--all his vital and intellectual force--seemed at once to desert him; insomuch that he positively withered up, shrivelled away, and almost vanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted wee that lies wilting in the sun (Hawthorne 224). Here, the fact that Chillingworth withered up after Dimmesdales demise further shows how dependent Chillingworth became on Dimmesdales guilt. Also, the metaphor that Chillingworth became an uprooted wee that lies wilting in the sun also shows this, because, similarly to how a plant feeds off water, Chillingworth fed off of Dimmesdales guilt and depended on it. After Chillingworths water was taken away from him, he eventually wilted in the sun. From how Chillingworth was eaten alive by his desire for revenge, instant gratification appears as an evil which destroys one's inner self.
	Even though these stories take place in the 17th century, we can still apply the lessons we learn to 2021. Delayed gratification is affiliated with hard work, in the sense that delayed gratification often requires hard work. Whether it is spending countless hours on an essay for English class, or training for a sports competition, hard work always pays off. Furthermore, instant gratification connects to careless work. For example, a surgeon in the operating room could be in a rush to get home and might accidentally make a careless mistake removing the wrong organ, resulting in severe problems for the patient. In the modern world, the lesson we can learn from The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter is that hard work pays off with reward, while careless work is paid for with punishment. This is because, after all, if you believe in yourself and work hard enough, anything is possible.

Facts of the Plessy v. Ferguson Case
In 1890, The "Separate Car Act" was passed in the state of Louisiana. This law required separate railway cars for black and white train passengers. Citizens from New Orleans formed a coalition called the Committee of Citizens in order to combat the Separate Car Act, and to have it be repealed by the courts. The Committee of Citizens persuaded Homer Plessy--a man with some African American ancestry, therefore being considered as black by the state of Louisana--to violate the law for the purpose of getting arrested so that the Committee might achieve their goals through a court case.
Esteemed Professor G. Heinrichs of the Downtown University once said, You cant petition to change a law unless someone gets harmed by it, this is the case with the Seperate Car Act, and Homer Plessy. On June 7, 1892, Homer Plessy boarded a "whites only" car in New Orleans and refused to leave when asked to move to the blacks-only car. Thereafter, Plessy was arrested.
Additionally, The railroad company was opposed to the Louisana state requirement of separate cars due to the increased costs for additional railcars.
Issue of the Matter
The case of Plessy v. Ferguson is a quandary of the 14th Amendment. The notion of separate but equal, as seen in the separation, yet inherit inequality, of train cars, violates this very amendment. Above all else, this case is a quintessential example of the oppression of liberty. The founding fathers, in 1776, did not being the journey to bring liberty to all Americans--both the grand liberty of freedom from oppression, to the mere liberty of choosing in what train car to sit--in order for liberty to be chopped up and split in half: Americans with liberty, and Americans without. The case of Plessy v. Ferguson needs to be an example of this dream of liberty, equal liberty, for all Americans, regardless of where their ancestors may hail.
Novel Argument
	The Supreme Court should rule in the favor of Plessy, acquitting the accused of violation of an unconstitutional law. This is because the Seperate Car Act of 1890 directly violates section one, clause two of the fourteenth amendment. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; First, establishing that the Seperate Car Act was established twenty years after the fourteenth amendment of 1868, it can be considered both a law made and enforced. And, this legislation directly abridged the privileges and immunities of Homer Plessy, a citizen of the United States, when he tried to ride a train car that was exclusive to a certain race.
It is the specific forcing of separation based upon race that is unconstituional. According the clause two of the first section of the fourteenth amendment, [No] state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. As can be seen, the fourteenth amendment guarantees equal protection of life and liberty to any person. Thus, the forced segregation of train cars, removes the liberty of choice, and also the liberty of comfort, given that the segregated cars are not truly equal.
The Seperate Car Act requires such an equality, [...] to provide equal but separate accommodations for the white and colored races, by providing separate coaches or compartments so as to secure separate accommodations, Regardless of the inherit inequality of two distinct train cars, the also declares that the railroad company shall be allowed to define punishment for any person who might sit in a location that is not deemed appropriate based on their race. Defining the duties of the officers of such railways; directing them to assign passengers to the coaches or compartments set aside for the use of the race to which such passengers belong; authorizing them to refuse to carry on their train such passengers as may refuse to occupy the coaches or compartment to which he or she is assigned; to exonerate such railway companies from any and all blame or damages that might proceed or result from such a refusal; to prescribe penalties for all violations of this act.
The two main culprits of unconstitutionality of this act are its requirement of separation in the first place, and its deprivation of liberty without the process of the law--based on the fact that the railway officers and railway companies shall be the judge and jury of the race of the passenger.
To begin with the latter, the officer of the railway or the railway company, as permitted in the act, may decide, to prescribe penalties for all violations of [the] act. The punishment given to Plessy by the railway company was to deprive him of his liberties, upon the discretion of the Louisiana Separate Car Act without due process of law. This lack of due process is not the only way in which the Separate Car Act is unconstitutional, the very basis of this act, as denoted in its name, requiring the separation of persons based upon race, is unconstitutional according to the Civil Rights Act of 1875. The Civil Rights Act protect[s] all citizens in their civil and legal rights. These rights are equal treatment in accommodations and transportation. In full, The Civil Rights Act states that, All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accomodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of publie amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, and applicable alike to citizens of every race and color, regardless of any previous condition of servitude. The requirement of seperation by the Separate Car Act is unequal treatment based upon race, and therefore, is unconstitutional.

Chair of Democratic Party
A Retrospective Look upon The Convention
	On the first morning of the convention, I opened with a change of plans. However, fortunately, this change of plans would not foreshadow any mercuriousness within the convention. Instead of the pledge of allegiance, I played the national anthem. Aside from this wavering from the plan, the first day of the convention went smoothly. The delegates had plenty of material prepared for the first morning, so I was able to sit back and let them project their ideas to the public with little moderation and involvement from my end. Given the fact that this was the opening day of the convention, I wanted to take the bus drivers seat in the bus that is the 1968 democratic convention. I wanted to steer the bus where it needed to go, but not stand up and bother the passengers while the bus was moving.
	With the beginning speeches aside, on the first day of debate, the delegates and I discussed domestic policies. I was hoping for a majority agreement on the domestic portion of the platform. Agreement and swift platforming in this stage would allow us to spend more time deciding on our platform for the most divisive issue, Vietnam. Decisive platforming would allow me and the delegates to select our nominee on the very first ballot. The delegates and I were able to come to a unanimous agreement upon the domestic platform. We proposed funding for physical infrastructure, and societal infrastructure--that is the war on poverty and the extension of the food stamp program. In regards to civil rights, a pressing and divisive issue--especially for myself, the delegates appeared rather inanimate and self-removed from the whole situation. Mayor R.  Daley claimed that federal legislation was sufficient as-is, and the states could manage civil rights, with the government only stepping in when it was needed. It seemed to me that the government was needed, and it was exactly our job to provide such a plan and nominee to execute upon it. The delegates were in agreement. So, while an absence of change was not particularly to my wishes, in the interest of party unison, I agreed to abstain from voting for the development of new civil rights legislation in our platform. Surprisingly, I anticipated civil rights to be a more major point of discord between the delegates in regards to our domestic platform, even perhaps cause for a walkout on someones behalf. Additionally, in regards to criminal justice, we sought to increase funding for the FBI, and to Mayor Daleys approval, funding for the police. And, we also wanted to provide support for criminal rehabilitation. Luckily, however, there were no walkouts, and the domestic platform was decided upon in unison. Finally, ending the first day, there was some protesting activity, however, there were no hospitalizations. I believe that young folks have a right to express their opinions, but I need them to not interfere with the democratic process. Mayor Daley expressed his idea that the protesters were merely walking about and not saying, really anything at all.
	The second day of the convention was lingering in my mind even before it had begun. After starting with the proper agenda, the pledge of allegiance this time, I had one idea in mind: what were we going to do about the war. The matter of foreign policy of Vietnam was, to my anticipation and in reality, the most split issue that needed to be decided for the platform. In combination with the day priors complaints that our stances on domestic policy were bland and uninteresting, for the purpose of movement and direction with the platform, the delegates suggested we avoid a mundane stance on Vietnam, and that radical action was required. This repulsion to mild-mannered policy, as phrased by some of the protestors, was bound to cause increased division amongst the delegates, especially on the already divisive issue of the war. Mr. J. Connally, and, to some extent, Mr. H. Humphery, were the main advocates of escalation against communism and extending the war to victory. Given that we restricted ourselves from taking little to no action in the war, their policies might not have been as drastic. However, the antiwar sentiment from Mr. T. Kennedy was going to be drastic and sweeping regardless of whether we were planning on making a mild decision or not. Kennedy moved for complete withdrawal initially, but in order to appeal to the equilibrium, moved for less extreme measures. Mayor Daley and I were driving forces in settling the two ends of thought from our delegates away from a push to victory or a recession into withdrawal. Eventually, despite the headcount of pro-war and anti-war persons suggesting that the final balance would lie favor of escalation, our platform landed upon de-escalation and reduction of troop numbers and the cessation of bombings about the 19th parallel. Ultimately the decision for de-escalation pleased me. A stark contrast between our democratic party and Nixon in regards to the war would help make a gray decision into black and white for the American voter. That afternoon, regretfully, intrusive moves from the protestors made it so that Mayor Daley needed to respond accordingly. In that response, one protestor, Bella Abzug, was hospitalized. As was said by the late Martin Luther King Jr., Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars... Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. So, violence from the police cannot stop violence from the protestors. In response to the war and its violence overseas, our next generation here is responding in the like. This prompted the third aggression on behalf of the police force. Whether any of this violence is justified is immaterial to me, because, as chair of the democratic party, I can only hope to reduce this sentiment of violence and war by advocating for the platform of de-escalation in Vietnam. This settlement of peace would hopefully influence peace here at home. Upon the second day, our platform had been established. Once again, our domestic policies were unanimous, moderate reforms in all areas but civil rights, in which we abstained. In order to begin the de-escalation in Vietnam, we decided that we were going to remove fifty thousand troops in addition to, as aforementioned, stop bombing at nineteen north.
	On the third and final day, after having solidified our platform, it was time for the delegates and me to decide upon the nominee. Initially, I had been leaning toward Mr. Humphrey as the nominee. He was a popular candidate, and despite his initial pro-war position, I figured he could mold into a good representative for our platform. However, Mayor Daley was the first to point out this contradiction in policy. Mr. Humphrey tried to reassure us of his experience and aptness for the nomination, and that his initial stance on the war would not be an issue. However, in pursuit of his own goal of the position of vice president, Mr. Connally began to reaffirm that we needed a candidate that was anti-war to support the anti-war de-escalation platform from the beginning. Additionally, Connally noted that the nomination could please more people if he, having a pro-war stance, joined in with whichever anti-war presidential nominee was chosen. It would provide voters with a wide spectrum of ideas on Vietnam, suggesting to the voters that there would be someone in the White House that would listen to what any given voter would have to say. Mayor Daley proposed Mr. George McGovern due to his anti-war opinions and alignment with our platform with respect to infrastructure and criminal justice. This proposal was acceptable to Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Connally. However, Mr. Humphrey still was adamant about his capacity to perform as the nominee. I agreed with Mayor Daley as well, in spite of the fact that Mr. Humphrey had done a great deal of campaigning and work in order to establish his position as a potential nominee in both the delegates eyes and the peoples eyes. Eventually, for the reason that McGovern would be a better match for our platform, Humphrey conceded and we rejoined to vote. All delegates unanimously voted for McGovern. I then made the mistake of suggesting to my fellow delegates that we begin the vote for the vice president, when Mayor Daley reminded me that McGovern would choose his vice president, even though a vote in absentia would make sense given that McGovern was not present. Regardless, John Connally determined himself to be the vice nominee and went to take the nomination acceptance speech. In the end, the delegates and I were pleased with the diversity between the stances of the nominees. We believed that McGovern and Connally would make strong candidates for the executive office. And, that is exactly what they did. Narrowly winning the election, the democrats maintained control of the White House this November. It is unlikely that Mr. William Burroughs of Esquire Magazine will have any outstanding remarks upon my actions as chairman. Nor is it likely that there will be any negative remarks. However, given that we maintained a spot in the White House, I believe that my actions as chairman and the work of my fellow delegates speak positively for themselves.
?My fellow Americans,
I am sure I need not tell you the weight of this moment after Bobby's recent death, especially considering Johns death 5 years ago. We are a nation in mourning, and we are hurt with invisible wounds, wounds that only time itself can heal. I need not tell you how influential, inspiring, and dedicated John and Bobby were, because these two men were more than that. These two men gave their lives to institute change in this country. They were ambitious, with true hearts, wanting the best for all american people. These two men were true Americans with a dream. They saw problems and tried to fix them, they saw violence and tried to make peace, and most importantly, they saw the potential of what America could become. John and Bobby dreamed of an America where all Americans are equal, where there is peace and prosperity throughout the whole country, where little poverty exists, and where songbirds could sing in the fresh morning air. They dreamed of a nation where people could accept one another, without judgment, and they had hope in the future of America. But America at this present moment is at the brink of division. There is inequality and violence in the streets, there is war in Vietnam, there is controversy in the whitehouse, and there is poverty throughout all of America. At this present time we shouldnt think to ourselves about the possibility that this nation might divide, but rather about the opportunity to unify and mend the nation back together. And the glue that will help bond this nation back together stronger than ever is civil rights and the sealant that will fill the crack is NOT a war in Vietnam, but a war against poverty. We cannot betray what John and Bobby died for, and what this nation has been fighting for ever since the first American Flag was raised. We cannot back down from the fight for civil rights for all Americans, and we will never give up until the war against poverty is won. We will together, as one nation, overcome any obstacles we are faced with and we can, and we will, together become the nation that John and Bobby dreamed of.
Thank you very much.?Alexandre Lipson

The Importance of Seeing for Yourself
	The keystone of the scientific method states that in order to test a hypothesis, one must test it with what one can observe. In order to prove a point or a hypothesis, you need evidence. However, evidence is not needed to merely make a point. While both making and proving a point are done in order to convince someone of something, the distinction between proving a point and making a point is that proving is backed by evidence or logos, while making a point can only be backed by ethos. Two books, set in the late 1600s in Salem, Massachusetts, provide insight into the effects of making points as opposed to proving them. Arthur Millers The Crucible describes a story about a town that is paranoid of witches and witchcraft. The town authorities believe the demise of all witches to be a panacea for witchcraft. The town judge executes upon this killing even when there is not only no evidence to support any crimes, but also evidence to contradict witchcraft having taken place. The townspeople of The Crucible yield to the ethos and influence of their authority figures and believe what they are told--that witchcraft is a serious and prevalent problem--instead of what they see--no witchcraft. Believing what someone says just because they are in a position of power is the appeal to authority fallacy. Eventually, the paranoia and the witch-hunting of witches caused the self-destruction of the entire town. Conversely, in Nathaniel Hawthornes The Scarlet Letter, the authority figures, such as the governor, make a statement regarding the punishment for a crime, but the townspeople do not listen to it. In this case, the governor decided to outcast Hester Prynne, who had committed adultery. However, the townspeople eventually disagree with their authority figures and see Hester as an able-bodied samaritan rather than a sinner. Instead of listening to just what they were told, the townspeople relied on what was evident to them in order to decide what to believe. Ultimately, Hester was able to find her way back into society. So, when the people of The Crucible listened to points made without evidence by their authorities, their town collapsed in on itself. Yet, when the people in The Scarlet Letter founded their ideas on evidence, they were able to reintegrate Hester into society. It is from these two books that we can see that when making a judgment or decision, one should pay attention to what is evident, and not just what is stated.
There is very little evidence of people committing witchcraft in The Crucible. The people of Salem do not get any valid evidence of witchcraft that proves the crimes took place. The only evidence that they do get is evidence planted by the creator of the witchcraft conspiracies, Abigail Williams. Firstly, when Abigail claimed that Elizabeth Proctor was committing witchcraft, the authorities, Marshall Ezekiel Cheever and Pastor John Hale, went to her house in order to meticulously find more--or in other words, fabricate--evidence to support Abigails claim. They located a puppet, an item that is affiliated with witchcraft. Specifically, puppets with needles in them are related to voodoo witchcraft originating from Louisiana and Haiti. Inside the puppet of interest, Marshall Cheever finds a needle. This needle intimates that Elizabeth had committed witchcraft only because of Abigails faked performance. Abigails faked performance occurred when she was sitting in the courtroom listing people she claimed to be witches
Cheever: Why - He draws out a long needle from the poppet - it is a needle! [...]
Proctor, angrily, bewildered: And what signifies a needle! [...] 
Cheever, wide-eyed, trembling: The girl, [Abigail Williams], sir. She sat to dinner in Reverend Parriss house tonight, and without word nor warnin she falls to the floor. Like a struck beast, he says, and screamed a scream that a bull would weep to hear. And he goes to save her, and, stuck two inches in the flesh of her belly, he draw a needle out. And demandin of her how she come to be so stabbed, she - to Proctor now - testify it - were your wifes familiar spirit pushed it in. 							(74) 
The puppet in Elizabeths possession had a needle in the same spot as where Abigail had been stabbed. However, Abigail was not in fact stabbed, but rather she feigned her injury. John Proctor, Elizabeth Proctor's husband, was present when the authorities came after Elizabeth, he inquired to Mary Warren about the origins of the doll.
	Proctor, quickly: [Mary Warren,] You stuck that needle in yourself?
Mary Warren: [...] I believe I did, sir [...] Let you ask Susanna Walcott - she saw me sewin it in court. Or better still: Ask Abby, Abby sat beside me when I made it.									(76)
When Abigail saw that Mary Warren was making a puppet and stabbed it with a needle, Abigail hatched a plan to pretend that the doll had some witchcraft ability to injure her, suggesting that Elizabeth Proctor, who would have the doll in her house, would have committed witchcraft. So, Abigail was able to forge evidence for accusations. While the doll is evident to the authorities, the legitimacy of the connection between the doll and witchcraft is not. The only evidence that exists is a false artifice designed to convict an innocent person of witchcraft. Second, Judge Danforth says that witchcraft is ipso facto--in Latin, by the very fact, meaning there are no witnesses; therefore, witchcraft cannot be evidenced as it cannot be seen. Danforth: [...] witchcraft is ipso facto, on its face and by its nature, an invisible crime, is it not? Therefore, who may possibly be a witness to it? (100). Since witchcraft is not evident, the townspeople cannot see that it took place. So, they have to rely on what they are told. Therefore, as an authority figure with ethos, Judge Danforth made the townspeople believe what he said, people are guilty, regardless if the town sees witchcraft or not.
Judge Danforth made a point that he is a powerful person to support his ethos, so the townspeople should believe in his decisions and what he says. For example, Francis Nurse claimed that he has evidence for Judge Danforth to see that exonerates his wife Rebecca Nurse. He pleaded for Judge Danforth to review it. However, Danforth wanted to protect his high reputation--he is even called your excellency (133). So, Danforth did not go back on his word of sentencing the townspeople to death because admitting he was wrong would damage his reputation and ethos.
Francis: Excellency, we have proof for your eyes; God forbid you shut them to it. The girls, sir, the girls are frauds. [...]
Danforth: Peace, Judge Hathorne. Do you know who I am, Mr. Nurse?
Francis: I surely do, sir, and I think you must be a wise judge to be what you are.
Danforth: And do you know that [nearly] four hundred are in the jails from Marblehead to Lynn, and upon my signature? [...] And seventy-two condemned to hang by that signature?					(87)
Judge Danforth suppressed the evidence brought before him. He said his decisions are what the town should believe, even when there was evidence--in the form of a confession from Mary Warren that she and Abigail were lying about her accusations of witchcraft--mounted against Danforths previous decisions. Even though there was no evidence for witchcraft--and, in fact, evidence for the contrary, because Judge Danforth was in a position of authority, he declared that the townspeople should consider his ruling as being the truth. Danforths insidious ruling that witchcraft took place and that those who he had sentenced are guilty ultimately causes the self-destruction of the town. So, because the townspeople in The Crucible believed what they were told and not what they saw, the town suffered.
	In regards to ruling authorities, the Puritan authorities in The Scarlet Letter decided Hesters punishment for her crime of adultery and how the town should treat her. Governor Bellingham decided that Hester would be banished to a cabin in the woods and be forced to wear a scarlet letter A on her chest to remind people that she committed adultery. This decision was made as opposed to sentencing Hester to death in accordance with the Bible. In response to Governor Bellinghams decision, a townsperson said, This woman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die; Is there not law for it? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute book." (79). The Scripture, meaning the Bible, is a primary text that states the appropriate and inclement punishment for adultery. The townsperson believes that Hesters punishment should be augmented from banishment to death because of the evidence from an important book in Puritan society, the Bible. So, Governor Bellingham abandoned the rules in order to make a point that Hester would merely be banished. In addition, another example of the abandonment of evidence was when Reverend Dimmesdale became physically ill from his guilt of having committed adultery without telling anyone. Dimmesdale was given aid by Roger Chillingworth, Hesters former husband. Chillingworth suspected that Dimmesdale was the one who committed adultery with his former wife. Chillingworths entire goal was to make Dimmesdale suffer as revenge. A description of Chillingworths character indicates that, Calm, gentle, passionless, as [Roger Chillingworth] appeared, there was yet, we fear, a quiet depth of malice, hitherto latent, but active now, in this unfortunate old man, which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy. (209). Chillingworth made a point that was contrary to the Bible and Puritan beliefs that say that it is Gods job to judge people.Chillingworth claimed responsibility for judging Dimmesdale for his sins. The townspeople allow Dimmesdale to continue to suffer because they do not know the real reason for why he is sick; his guilt is not evident, so the townspeople cannot influence his fate from Chillingworth. So, authority figures, such as Governor Bellingham and Doctor Roger Chillingworth, oppose the religious rule evidenced in the Bible and make decisions that are based on what they want to say instead.
	Despite the Governers point that Hester should be banished, the townsfolk change their mind from alienating her to appreciating her work. We can see Hesters pathway to redemption via her making clothes for everyone in the town. After being cast out from the Puritan community, Hester was only able to return to the society because of the need for her garment craftsmanship abilities. While previously she had no purpose, she gained purpose by helping, wretches less miserable than herself, (75). The author, describing Hesters reconnection with the community, said, From the delicate toil of the needle. [...] In this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the world.  (76). This represents the next step in Hesters journey, her return to society shifts how she is viewed. While she cannot make wedding dresses, as her crime related to marriage still stings Hester too pungently to stain the pureness of a wedding dress (77), the majority of the town allowed her to move forward. However, this process of forgiving is not entirely complete yet, as those that Hester helped not infrequently insulted the hand that fed them. (75). The townspeople had the clothes as evidence that Hester is producing for the town, and they began to realize that she could be forgiven of her sins. After some time, a meteor appeared in the sky that made the shape of a red letter A in the sky. All the townspeople could see this phenomenon, and they interpreted it as more evidence for a change in the meaning of Hesters red letter, from adulterer to able. Looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the appearance of an immense letterthe letter Amarked out in lines of dull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point, burning duskily through a veil of cloud. (234). The red letter A, coming from sky, was evidence to the people that Hester was like an able-bodied angel. The fact that the townspeople used what they saw in Hesters deeds and the Earths sky in order to decide the judgment of Hester, as opposed to just listening to Governor Bellingham allowed them to come to a more informed decision. Overall, using evidence led to a redressal of Hesters status in society. Her reincorporation was a better outcome than being sentenced to exile or death because it was backed by evidence.
Socrates once said, To Believe without evidence and demonstration is an act of ignorance and folly. We can see from all this, to avoid ignorance and folly, it is crucial to pay attention to what is evident prior to making a decision or a judgment. In the context of highschool in 2021, people, especially teenagers with developing brains, make mistakes. When a mistake is made, it is important to look at the intent as opposed to the impact. A persons intent cannot be seen when they make a decision. In this case, when a mistake is made, one must ascertain the intent behind a mistake in order to properly deal with it. For example, if a classmate is discussing work they did on an assignment, in order to support them assuage of any worries about their grade, one might suggest to their classmate that the classmates work is good and that the classmate is bound to receive a good grade. The intent in this situation is to calm the classmate. However, sometimes the classmate might see the esteem of their work as being insincere, rather than as being supportive. The burden of removing confusion lies upon the benefactor, to reiterate that their intent was unfeigned. Similarly, in The Crucible, If someone had stopped to verify Abigails claims, to see if anyone was actually committing malevolent witchcraft, the town could have avoided the cascade of punitive measures and death that resulted from the town listening to authority and witnessing evidence of witchcraft themselves. However, the townspeople of The Scarlet Letter took the time to evaluate Hesters mistake in order to reach a constructive solution such as the reintegration of Hester into society. Therefore, in order to reach an informed decision one should make sure that they can see the entire picture, especially if there exists a discrepancy between what is said and can be seen. However, it is very difficult to see all the evidence in every situation. A primary example of this is the interaction between a people and their government. Their government may, like the United States government, have some classified information which the people cannot see. In circumstances such as these, where one cannot see what is evident, is it acceptable to rely merely on what is said?

Cuentas de Inmigrantes en Cancines
Luca Millard-Kish
El arte de los ciudadanos Mxico Americanos, en el forma de cancines, puede refleja los sentimiento complicados sobre se identidad. Personas diferentes se sienten diferente sobre su mezcla de dos culturas; algunos sienten atrapado, algunos sienten orgulloso. Es dudosa que todas las inmigrantes sientan el mismo. Este ensayo breve voy a enfocar en tres cancines diferentes que nos muestran estos sentimientos complicados. 
Primero, en la cancin La Juala De Oro, por Los Tigres del Notes, la letra dice [...] si estoy como prisionero, dentro desta gran nacin, cuando me acuerdo hasta lloro, aunque la juala sea de oro, no deja de ser prisin. Para estas artistas, el gran nacin de America es como una juala. Ellos sienten atrapado. Pero, el juala es hecho de oro. Este yuxtaposicin entre el parte con dolor, el juala, y el parte dichoso, el oro, muestra el conflicto emocional de los ciudadanos Mxico Americanos. La siguente ejemplo tiene un sentimiento muy differente. En la cancin Mxico Americano, de Los Lobos, las artistas toman orgullo en la mezcla de races. Cuando dicen, Por mi madre yo soy Mexicano, Por destino soy Americano, Yo soy de la raza de oro. Yo soy Mxico Americano, ellos comentan en la parte de la mezcla que los hicen especial. Por ltimo, nosotros podemos ver la dualidad de los sentimientos y los sentimientos en conflicto. La cancin Por Si Acaso No Regreso, por Celia Cruz, ella dice Y siempre me sent dichosa, de haber nacido entre tus brazos. Y aunque ya no est, de me corazn te dejo un pedazo [...] Podemos ver que aunque ella has tenido una carrera exitosa, ella todava extra su pas de hogar, Cuba, durante el proceso de escribiendo este cancin. Ella senta nostlgica.
	En conclusin, cuando nosotros vemos este fenmeno de expresin y narracin con las cancines, podemos apreciar y entender ms mejor los sentimientos de las personas Mxico Americanas. A mi me gustas este forma de expresin porque me encanta msica. Aunque los voces de ellos hay usualmente suprimido, ellos nos pueden compartir sus realidades con msica. De las tres cancines, podemos ver que la sentimientos diferentes y conflictivos de los inmigrantes, una perspectiva nueva para algunos. Algunos inmigrantes encantan la mezcla, algunos se sienten atrapados, pero todos tienen races fuerte con sus pases natales.?Alex Lipson

Dedes Methods of Overcoming Her Fears of Joining the Revolution
Each of the sisters in In the Time of the Butterflies plays a part in the underground revolution against the dictator Trujillo. However, Dede had a unique involvement. And once, as Dede put it, she was, her little underground of one. (181). While each sister had her own struggle to join and to progress the movement, Dede is the sister with the most difficult time joining. While her three other sisters had to struggle with their own decisions and involvement in the movement, Dede is so hesitant to join the movement that she only realized her purpose in it after the movement was over. The nature of Dedes hesitation evolves over time. She is hesitant of ways, but eventually, she overcomes her fears for multifarious reasons.
In comparison to her sisters, Dede had fewer external life-changing experiences that caused her to join the movement. Patria is most comparable to Dede in her level of hesitation about joining the movement. However, Dede does not have an external motivation to join the movement as Patria does. Patria sees the effects of the regime by watching the soldier boy die at the Church on the hill. Dede does not undergo a motivating experience mostly because Dede typically is confined to her familial duties at home. However, even though she was at home, she still felt the stress of the regime. However, Dede was motivated, although not to join the movement directly, to be courageous and not abandon her family out of cravenness. Dede thought about her own family with Jaimito the night after hearing that the SIM had taken Minerva to prison. [Dede] felt a temptation to just let go. To let the craziness overtake her before the SIM could destroy all she loved. But who would take care of her boys? And Mama? Dede could not run away. Courage! It was the first time she had used that word to herself and understood exactly what it meant. (198). Dedes revelation that she needs to stay strong and be, as she says, courageous for her family. So, Dedes implication in the movement is driven by her courage and bravery. In terms of when she feels courageous, Dede says that she felt the courage to protect her family, but she also says that she lacks bravery on her own. Jaimito threatened to leave Dede if she joined the movement. After Jaimito suspected that Dede was considering joining, he took the children to San Francisco. Dede spoke with Minerva about the situation. Ded began to cry, I just have to admit to myself. Im not you [, Minerva, Im not brave]. (186). [Dede] felt brave with Minerva at her side. (187). Dede feels brave when she is with her sisters. This means that with her sisters, Dede can overcome her fear.
Dede makes some compromises with her husband Jaimito, however, in secret, she rebels against him by listening to a forbidden radio station. Dedes husband Jaimito forbids Dede from joining the movement. A barrier like this is not seen with the other sisters. When Mate was in jail and somberly wondering about the outside world, she said, I wanted an excuse to stay home. Like Dede, I just didnt have the nerves for revolution, but unlike her, I didnt have the excuse of a bossy husband. (240). Jaimito is both a literal and symbolic block for Dede. Dede doesnt acknowledge to her sisters that Jaimito is blocking her from doing what she wants to. In fact, she defends him to her sisters after they accuse Jaimito of being a regime supporter. Dede says, Jaimitos no trujillista, [...] No more than Pap. (179). Comparing Jaimito to the sisters father shows both a similar value of importance that Dede places on Jaimito and her father. And, the comparison also shows that the sisters father was flawed like Jaimito. However, Dede rebelled against Jaimito without her sisters knowing. Dede mused about Lio and Minerva intimated that he was speaking on the radio. [Minerva told Dede,] Tune into Radio Rumbox, 99 on your dial. Minerva knew Jaimito would be furious if he found Dede listening to that outlawed station. [...] her little underground of one. (181). Dedes underground of one, while not the actual movement, shows a degree of courage that Dede has for rebellion. Dede was willing to risk her security with Jaimito to hear Lio. While unrelated to her confidence, the fact that Dede rebels against Jaimito for Lio suggests that their relationship is tentative in nature. [Dede] knew, her knees shaking, her breath coming short, that she could not go through with this business. Jaimito was just an excuse. She was afraid, plain and simple, just as she had been afraid to face her powerful feelings for Lio. Instead, she had married Jaimito, although she knew she did not love him enough. (184). This compromise of being with Jaimito when she still had feelings for Lio could parallel Dedes overall yielding to outside stress. In terms of the movement, this can be seen as not overcoming the stress of her fears and not joining her sisters in the underground. However, Dede eventually overcomes her confinement of Jaimito by doing what he forbids, listening to the radio, in order to hear Lio. So, Dede overcomes her hesitation because of love.
Many years after the movement ended, Dede realized her purpose. This allowed her to overcome her hesitation. When Dede recalls the story of her sisters, she regrets not having joined them, and not having done more for the revolution. She overcame her hesitation, but she did so too late. Jaimito, in fact, was the one who gave Dede a focus to tell the story of Dedes sisters. So, with a purpose, Dede was able to overcome her hesitation. At one point, Dede developed enough courage to rebel in such a manner that could have ended up with her dying. Part of Dedes rationale for acting in such a manner could be related to grief over her sisters death which would cause her to act unreasonably. After she hears that her sisters died, Dede was in shock and talking to Jaimito. [Jaimito said,] Dede, what is it you want--to get yourself killed, too? I nodded. I said, I want to be with them. [my sisters.] This is your martyrdom, Dede, to be alive without them. (308). Dedes purpose in the movement, provided to her by Jaimito, was only realized after it was already over. As Jaimito helper her see, her purpose was to stay alive to share her sisters stories. Dede had to endure through remembering her sister's experience so she can educate the next generation of the journalist and her sisters children. However, she would not have overcome her hesitation without the help of Jaimito.
Dede overcame her hesitation in a variety of ways. The obstacles Dede faced in joining the movement were internal, such as lack of courage. She overcame these obstacles through a connection with companionship and love. Because of the fact that Dede needed to connect with others in order to overcome her fears, this could suggest that she is the least self-reliant of the sisters.?Luca Millard-Kish

Literary Techniques to Show Character
Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass. This quote, by Anton Chekov, encapsulates the essence of showing rather than telling emotion in narrative fiction. Since short stories, a type of narrative fiction, dont always focus on a plot, like in genre fiction, theyre just meant to depict a fragment of the narrative arc, usually a moment of realization or character evolution. Reading a short story is about asking questions of the text to decipher the authors point. There are two ways to approach storytelling: telling, when we state the emotions and internal shifts of the characters outright, and showing, when we depict the result of these emotions and shifts through the characters actions and dialogue. When we show the characters emotions, we let the readers interpret the scene. An effective way to do this is through literary devices such as imagery, dialogue, and juxtaposition. Well focus on imagery as it appears in the following short stories: The Lottery, To Build A Fire, and Eves Diary. With examples from these stories, well see how to write engaging fiction by showing the characters' inner states rather than stating them explicitly.
	Imagine that the sun has barely risen in the sky as youre wandering through the frigid Yukon, alone. Grey and still, the vast and frozen world stretches to meet the horizon. Are you interested yet? Are you wondering whats going to happen next? If youll be ok? Well, in Jack Londons, To Build a Fire, London expresses emotion by evoking the five senses with imagery. This device is helpful to show characters emotions because it sets the scene and emphasizes descriptions to make a point. For example, London writes, Day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the high earth-bank, where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland. (London 1) This adroit use of imagery paints a vivid picture of the vast landscape and shows how alone the man really is by emphasizing his complete isolation. And, with the repetition of cold and grey, the readers imagination is trigger and they begin to use their human ability to create a narrative from literary clues to interpret the emotional state of the man in this story. Imagery can be used to show scale, but it can also be used to describe fine detail. For example, at the point of critical discovery of fire in Mark Twains Eves Diary, Twain writes,  A thin transparent bluish film rose out of the hole, and I [Eve] dropped everything and ran! (Twain 10) This instance of imagery, evoking a sense of wonder and intrigue, presents Eves innocence and capriciousness. First of all, most everybody knows what fire is, and that is not a description of the menacing flames that were all accustomed to. So, in depicting fire in those gentle terms, Twain not only mirrors the gentleness of Eves innocent spirit, but also makes the reader focus on her ignorance about the world she was just brought into. The last example comes from the beginning of Shirley Jacksons, The Lottery. The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. (Jackson 1) This florid imagery contrasts the macabre subject of the story and sets up the emotion to be purely superficial and carefree. This mood is later juxtaposed with the dark topic of innocent sacrifice. By avoiding the reality of the story, in the beginning, Jackson lets the reader come to their own conclusions about the townspeoples ignorance. By doing so, Jackson triggers the readers imagination and makes the authors point about the dangers of blindly following tradition even more impactful. From the examples above, we can conclude that imagery is a useful tool in narrative fiction. By engaging the readers senses, the we can put the story in perspective and draw attention to crucial details.
So, do you trust your writing enough to trust your reader? This is the creative risk we take when we choose to show rather than tell whats happening inside the heads of our characters. Showing can lead to a more captivating story since it requires us to engage our brains. To pick up on the hinted nuances, we have to think. In conclusion, when youre looking to intrigue your readers, showing, which leads to their increased imagination and commitment, can express characters emotions in a way that makes the reader want to turn the next page.

Expository Essay: Showing vs. Telling
Dont tell me the moon is shining, show me the glint of the light on broken glass. - Anton Checkhov
One of the key components of short stories is their ability to show the reader a situation indirectly rather than just outright telling them. Short stories are interesting in the fact that they rarely have a complete narrative arc. Instead, short stories are more about the characters and less about the plot. One might ask, What is the story even about? The truth is, more often than not, not much happens in short stories, but that's not the point. To discover the meaning of short stories we must look at what the characters are learning/realizing, and the point that is being made. 
To begin, let us go over what it means when an author shows versus tells something. The ability to show is when authors hint at something without outright saying it, and telling is when authors simply tell the reader the situation without describing or hinting at it. For example, if an author wrote Oliver is mad., they only told the reader what Oliver is feeling. Instead, if the author wrote Olivers face turned red as a fire truck as he scrunched his face in fury., the author depicts Olivers actions to show the reader how Oliver is feeling. In other words, its better to show behavior rather than just tell emotion because it allows the reader to imagine whats happening in their mind. Showing forces the reader to use their own imagination to think Why? while also bringing deeper description and imagery. Some examples of literary techniques that authors use for showing are: description, tone, modifiers, and attributions. Although, we will focus mainly on the use of attributions in the short stories The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, To Build a Fire by Jack London, and Thank You Maam by Langston Hughes. In each of these stories, the use of attributions helps reveal the emotional state of the characters.
Attributions are extremely important in our understanding of a character because they reveal who the character is as a person. The way people talk reveals who they are, which is why dialogue in short stories is so important. In other words, dialogue in stories is less about what the characters do and more about who they are and what they are feeling.
In Thank You Maam, by Langston Hughes, the story begins with a boy attempting to snatch a womans pocketbook. Although, after he fails to accomplish his task, the woman catches him and doesnt release him. After the woman looks the boy in the eyes and tells him she wont let him go, we can see through the boys guilt when he says Im very sorry, lady, Im sorry, whispered the boy (Hughes 1). Here, the word whispered is emphasized as a negative word that is defined as speaking very softly using one's breath. This particular word however reveals the boys compunction by attributing the word whisper to the feeling of shame, for if the boy didnt feel guilty, he wouldn't have whispered that he was very sorry at all. Langston Hughes highlights the word very to show that the boy is not just sorry, but sorry in high degree. From this we can conclude that the boy regrets his actions and feels remorse for what he has done.
Towards the end of Jack Londons To Build a Fire, the main character, a conceited man navigating through the Yukon, steps through the ice covering a river and submerges his foot in the cold water. This situation is dangerous in such a cold landscape, and the only way to save ones self is to build a fire. After numerous failed attempts to build a fire, the man becomes weak and loses his strength. He then panics and runs through the forest desperately looking for any chance to stay alive. After he eventually collapses out of fatigue and weakness, he accepts his fate and regrets disobeying the advice of an old man in Sulfur Creek, who said he should never travel without a partner. Indeed, You were right, old hoss; you were right, the man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek (London 11). Here, when the man mumbled that the old hoss in Sulfur Creek was right, the man shows his anger toward the man in Sulfur Creek after he was proved wrong. The man uses old hoss as a negative word towards the man in sulfur creek as a way to express the mans irritation that he was wrong. The word mumbled is also emphasized as a negative word that is defined as saying something indistinctly and quietly. This particular word reveals the mans emotion by using the attribution mumbled to show the reader that the man has given up and accepted that the man in Sulfur Creek was right. We know this because if the man still thought he could safely go alone, he wouldn't have mentioned at all that the man in Sulfur Creek was right. From this we can conclude that the man has accepted his fate and recognizes that he was wrong. 
In the end, there isnt one specific way to show something to the reader. Authors use many different literary devices to hint to readers certain things, like a character's emotions. These hints are ways authors can create clues to what a character could be feeling or thinking, and the reader has to be a detective using each clue to solve the mystery. This is a risk authors have to take when they show something to the reader. Sometimes the reader might overlook or misinterpret the clues the author leaves in the text, and in the process they could miss the whole point of the story. More or less, if one wants to find the true meaning of a story, one must read in between the lines.?The first literary technique we will discuss is the use of modifiers, which is one of the ways authors use in showing a situation. A modifier is a type of descriptive verb that adds further detail to the action of a character. Modifiers can show a lot about the state of the characters to the reader. An author can use modifiers to hint to the reader what a character is thinking or feeling without directly saying it. In The Lottery, Shirley Jackson uses modifiers to hint the state of the characters to the reader. We can see this when Mrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front (Jackson 4). The word craned hints to the reader that Mrs. Hutchinson is eager. The text does this by hinting at Mrs. Hutchinsons alacrity by using the word craned to describe her enthusiasm to find her family and get on with the lottery. We can also find the use of modifiers in Ambrose Bierces An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge when the narrator explains [the mans] brain was on fire, his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out of his mouth (Bierce 4). In the text, Bierce uses modifiers like fluttering and force to intensify the story and bring feelings of suspense and action to the reader, while also hinting that the man is fearing for his life and apprehensive. The final example we are going to go over is from Jack Londons To Build a Fire when the narrator explains [the man] plunged in among the big spruce trees (London 2). In this example, the word plunged hints to the reader the mans overconfidence by showing the reader the mans exuberance and arrogance.    
Not only do these examples show how authors can allude characters emotions to the reader by using modifiers, but they also show how readers can accurately catch a characters emotion by reading in-between the lines.
 Finally, the last literary technique we are going to covor is tone. Earlier, we mentioned how attributions can reveal the tone of characters in dialogue, but tone can be its own literary device. By itself, tone can greatly impact the readers perspective of the story and characters. The reason tone has the ability to show and not tell is because it reveals the character/narrators attitude toward something which can lead to the character/narrators emotion. For example, in The Lottery, by Shirley Jackson, the tone of the narrator shifts the readers perspective of the story. In the beginning of the story, Jackson establishes a matter of fact tone to show the reader a certain perspective of what the lottery is without directly writing it. We can see this when narrator explains The children assembled first, of course (Jackson 1). In this example, the text really hints to the reader that this event is casual and ordinary by using an apathetic tone. Not only does this greatly impact the readers perception of the story, but the tone also sets the reader up with a fixed perspective which will dramatically shift towards the end of the narrative. We see another example of this is in Eves Diary, by Mark Twain, when Eve says Do not be downhearted, you poor friendless girl; I will be your friend (Twain 8). In the text, Eves tone really hints at her self pity, while also guiding the reader to empathize with her. The text does this by using depressing words such as poor and friendless to spur emotion in the reader. This connects the reader more deeply to the story and characters. We can also see the use of tone in An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, by Ambrose Bierce, when the narrator explains No service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the South (Bierce 3). In the text, the tone shows the protagonists romanticized view of the civil war using the words humble and  aid to play with the readers perspective and interpretation of the story.
Not only can tone play a major role on how the reader interprets a characters emotions (by showing the character/narrators attitude toward something), but tone can also change the readers perspective on the story and have an effect on the reader as well.
From these examples we can discern that the use of attributions can play a major role in showing the reader the current emotional state of the characters by revealing the characters tone.
In the end, one might ask themself, Why is showing so much more effective than telling?, but the truth is sometimes it isnt. It depends on what an author is trying to accomplish. In most cases however, the reason showing is more effective than telling is because it lets the reader use their imagination to see the story through descriptive language and also lets the reader interpret the text based on their own life. One of the many brilliances of literature is that it can be different for everyone. There is no right or wrong answer. Even though showing is usually more effective than telling, some pitfalls of showing are that the story could be misinterpreted or misconstrued by readers. This is because since the text doesnt clearly elucidate the situation, its up to the reader to interpret it, and sometimes the reader might interpret the text differently than what the author intended them to. So why dont authors just tell a situation instead? Well, some pitfalls of telling are that it doesnt reveal much of the characters and is a lot less descriptive than showing. Although, telling can be effective in creating a matter of fact tone, and even though telling is a lot less descriptive, it can really get a point across easily. So when should an author show or tell? To be honest, there is no right or wrong way to know when to show or when to tell, it all just depends on what the author is trying to accomplish and the point the author is trying to send across to the reader.
Towards the end of The Lottery, by Shirley Jackson, Mrs. Hutchinson, who was originally excited about the lottery, ends up having the winning ticket. Although, instead of winning money, Mrs. Hutchinson is stoned to death. As the people pick up rocks to throw at her, she desperately yells It isnt fair, it isnt right, Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her (Jackson 10). Here, the attribution screamed emphasized as a negative word that is defined as giving a loud cry expressing emotional or physical pain or panic. In this specific scenario, however, the word hints at Mrs. Hutchinsons feeling of desperation. This is because if she didnt feel desperate, she wouldnt have said anything at all and just accepted her fate in the hopeless situation. Also, the word fair is highlighted to show the reader Mrs. Hutchinsons change of perspective after the beginning of the story, when she was excited for the lottery and treated it as a casual event. From this we can conclude that Mrs. Hutchinson is desperate to stay alive and cannot accept her future. We can also conclude that one of the themes of the story is that one can never see the true horrors of something until they themselves are picked to experience it.
Attributions are often used after dialogue to indicate that a character has spoken, but attributions can do much more than just that. An attribution can also describe the way a character spoke, or the tone the character used in dialogue, which can be a BIG hint to the reader of the characters current state or emotion. This is due to the fact that the tone of a persons voice can play a major role in how they are interpreted.

The Corrosive Effects of Shame
Bren Brown, a researcher and writer who specializes in shame and the ability to grow from it, says that Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change (Brown). An important distinction to make is between shame and guilt. Dr. Brown says that The difference between shame and guilt is the difference between I am bad and I did something bad (Brown). One defines us, yet one we choose how to define. We feel either of these feelings when we do something that contradicts the morality of our society or ourselves. In the novel, The Scarlet Letter, and the play, The Crucible, the authors show us the ramifications of such moral transgressions, specifically within the Puritan society. Puritans believe, among other things, that one must fully repent to God for their sins and that their salvation or damnation rests on the limpid state of their religious purity. In this morally trenchant environment, the ideas of public shame and personal guilt are viewed as necessary means to purge yourself of your wrongdoings. In The Scarlet Letter, Hester Prynne commits adultery, an abomination to the Puritan belief system. She, therefore, is publicly pilloried for her ignominious actions, sentenced to live her life in exile with a scarlet letter branded to her chest, a symbol of her sin. In The Crucible, however, while not one individual was the target of the shaming, the accusations run rampant in a time of suspected witchcraft. These allegations are used to shift conjectures from one townsperson to the other attempting to hide from the courts. Neither of these reactions frees the towns from the miscreants who taint them. In neither of these reactions does the authority and town consider the corrosive effect of shame as mentioned above. The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter, therefore, teach us that public shame and humiliation as a punishment for moral transgressions are unjust and ineffective.
	In both stories, upon hearing the news that someone has sinned, the townspeople instantly turn to blaming, shaming, and gossip. This reaction to such a crisis does nothing to get to the root of the issue. In The Crucible, when Abigail is accused of practicing witchcraft in the woods, she blames Tituba to shift the blame from herself. When questioned, she replies, "She made me do it! She made Betty do it!" (Miller, 43). She is shaming Tituba to protect herself from defamation. In another example from The Scarlet Letter, we see the even more blatant shaming of Hester Prynne. At the beginning of the book, the townspeople disparage Hester and feel that she has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die. They see the scarlet letter as insufficient punishment for sin as terrible as adultery. Looking toward their strict set of morals, codified into law, they ask, Is there not law for it? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book (Hawthorne, 49). Both of these examples show us that the townspeople attempt to quell the effect of moral transgressions by punishing the sinners with shame. As mentioned by Dr. Brown at the beginning, this inhibits the sinners from changing to better fit the prescribed set of Puritan morals, purity included. When the sinner is accused of something bad, they often end up feeling worse. When that feeling festers, then the sinners are more likely to act out yet again. Shaming as punishment does nothing but perpetuate this vicious cycle.
	One key issue in both The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible is this idea of purity throughout the town. Purity in the depicted societies is freedom from moral contamination. While the townspeople and authority figures chastise others for their sins, they often overlook their own morally questionable actions. In The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne gives us a window, through Hesters experience with the scarlet letter, into the lives of the elite. Hester shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing, that [the scarlet letter] gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts (Hawthorne, 90). This sympathetic knowledge is often triggered by her proximity to the authority figures because Sometimes, the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate, the model of piety and justice [...] (Hawthorne, 90) This alludes to the fact that the ministers and magistrates might not be as pure as their facades suggest. In this highly religious society, the authority figures are closest to God by their divine right to rule, yet Hesters sympathetic throb senses kinship. While the impurity of the authority figures in The Scarlet Letter is left hidden, only to be noticed by Hester, the authority figures depicted in The Crucible are left entirely unscathed by suspicion. When Hale confronts Danforth saying that There is a prodigious fear of this court in the country, Danforth retaliates by saying Then there is a prodigious guilt in the country." (Miller, 98) By doing so, Danforth effectively shifts any blame directed at the courts and himself back onto the people. Danforth is representative of the law, yet in this play where shame and guilt are thematized Danforths callous denial to take the blame himself shows the hidden corruption within the government. In The Crucible, there is no evidential ground for the accusations to stand on so the theocratic government remains untouched by the prospect of sin within the governing body. The fact that the authority figures are also guilty of sin, whether they express it or not, shows that we as humans are flawed. Accepting this reality, all of the authority figures in both of these stories should have humility in their roles as leaders.
	An effective leader who celebrates those who are succeeding would be remiss in their duty to not also lift up those who are struggling. Recognizing that its not in our infallibility, but in our ability to grow from our mistakes, is the missing piece in the leadership depicted in these two stories. At the beginning of The Scarlet Letter, while Hester sewed for the authority figures, It [was] not recorded that, in a single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushed of a bride. The exception indicated the ever relentless vigor with which the society frowned upon her sin (Hawthorne, 86). This ever relentless vigor subsides over the course of the story as the townspeoples stringent views of sin are swayed to become more understanding. This shift in thinking begins when they recognize that Hesters fellow sinner, Dimmesdale, After exhausting life in his efforts for mankinds spiritual good, [...] had made the manner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike (Hawthorne, 268). Through the parable of Dimmesdales life and suffering, the townspeople transform their views. Initially alienating the sinner, they can now embrace the fact that were all imperfect. We are sinners all alike (Hawthorne, 268). From this change, we can see that The Scarlet Letter takes an empathetic, and arguably more modern, approach to sin. In contrast, in The Crucible, Danforths pride inhibits him from evolving his thinking, even after he starts to question his initial perception of the issue of witchcraft. He says that [He] cannot pardon these when twelve are already hanged for the same crime. It is not just" (Miller, 129). The rigidity of both Danforth and the courts in their inability to evolve their ideas is detrimental in The Crucible, as it results in the loss of more innocent lives. While Danforth is steadfast in his beliefs, which is a noble thing, his pride blinds him from the consequences of his obstinance. 
	As shown above, the people in The Crucible fail to evolve from their predetermined assumptions and convictions about witchcraft. On the other hand, the people in The Scarlet Letter allow their perception of sin to change. While the townspeople in The Scarlet Letter do evolve, their instinctual reaction was still to outcast and shame the sinner. But, from the evidence and analysis above, we can conclude that it would be more effective to address the issue of sin with compassion and inclusion from the beginning. To extract this lesson and apply it to modern times, lets look at a concrete example. Your child, a new driver, gets their first speeding ticket.  At first, youre quite frustrated about paying the fine, but then you have a couple of choices about how you handle the situation. First, as the Puritans would, you could banish your child from driving the car and hope that the shame of speeding will eventually teach them to not do it in the future. On the other hand, with the lessons obtained from the two stories, you could realize your irritation but then approach the situation with altruism, teaching the child how to watch for speed limit signs and remain safe while driving. As Dr. Brown tells us, If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding shame cant survive (Brown). This idea that I am bad does nothing in working towards the society that the Puritans were after many years ago or towards the society that we want to live in today. We can learn from both of these stories to approach moral transgressions with a more open mindset to try to welcome the sinner back into society and give them a sense of belonging.

?Think back about your learning and creations over the past three weeks. As a reminder, we've explored:
Photography
Stop Motion Animation
Principles of Design
Graphic Design
Branding
Using digital tools to make traditional art accessible online
Video/Audio
During the middle block on Friday, September 18, you'll have time to write a ~1 page reflection where you address the following:
Which form(s) of digital art to you enjoy most? Why?
Which form(s) of digital art required you to learn the most? What specific concepts/skills did you have to learn?
Which form(s) of digital art are less appealing to you?
Which project (Photography Portfolio, Stop Motion Film, Personal Branding Portfolio, PSA Posters, Instructional Video) are you most proud of? Why?
How will you continue to expand and/or use your skills in digital media going forward? Be as specific as you can be.
	I enjoy graphic design the most because there isnt anything that I need other than my ideas. With photography, I need a good camera, and something to take a picture of. Albeit with graphic design one might need software to have fun making designs. I also have the most previous experience with graphic design. I have limited experience with the other topics.
	I think I had to learn the most in terms of branding and icon making. I knew previously that icons needed meaning beyond just looking interesting. The most complicated elements of icon design to me were the branding why statement and how that could be used to influence the design of an icon. I understand that a lot of the conversion is metaphorical and subjective in terms of what images mean to different people, so for those reasons I think the branding why statement was the hardest to understand. I dont know if I have fully learned about how to incorporate the why statement, but the skills that I would need to further develop is the ability to translate a message into an image or symbol--which I know is the entire icon making process. So, to reiterate it all, I found the meaning behind icons difficult to convery, and I could work on that in the future.
	As I mentioned in what forms of art I liked, the inverse applies to what I dislike. I dont enjoy photography and videography because it requires objects that I might not have at my disposal. I think the mindset behind photography is to be creative with what is at your disposal, but I enjoy the mindset behind drawing or graphic design of being creative with whatever you can put down on paper--or some other medium. But I think that when using other mediums that brings in an element of requiring tools that are beyond ones own imagination. So, while paper might be limiting in a medium sense, it also allows for freedom in the sense that all else that is needed is a pen and your brain. Also, Stop motion was very frustrating because I couldnt get a good camera setup. I recall seeing a framed rig with a fixed camera that was angled at a fixed workspace on time. A setup like that where I only had to worry about the content and not the setup would have been more fun given the time we had to record the stop motion videos.
	I am not particularly proud of any of my work. I tried my best on each project, but I really am not very proud of anything in particular. I had the most fun working on the graphic design project, so that is what I am most proud of. This is likely because I had the ability to use the skills that I have previously learned and practiced. Going off on another tangent, I am not really proud of or enjoy most of, if not all of the artwork I do. I think this is the case for a lot of people. It doesnt come from a place of saying that my artwork sucks and fishing for compliments or anything--which I hope that saying that I am not proud of my work is perceived as. Merely just that I tried my best and any enjoyment I might have had from the product, I received in the process, and not the result. Regardless, I guess it is fair to say that I am most proud of the graphic design project because I enjoyed the process of making it the most.
	Since I enjoy playing with graphic design outside of school, I think the skills that I learned during the intensive can carry over. With that being said, I dont think that what I make will improve that much--not because I didnt learn anything, but because learning the design principles is one thing, while applying them effectively takes more practice than we can get in 3 weeks of intensive. So, I hope to practice the application of my newly learnd design principles as I continue to make projects in and out of school.?First Amendment

Speech
The first amendment was the first-ever evolutionary event in the life of the constitution, this amendment said not what Congress should do, but rather, what it should not. Due to its brevity, the entire amendment can be read. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Most importantly, and most relevantly to the three cases of Schneck, Debs, and Abrams, and the Espionage Acts, the first amendment says that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. Abridging, in a legal sense, nearly means curtailing, which means imposing a restriction upon. So, Congress shall not make any law restricting the freedom of speech. However, the supreme court, incorrectly in some cases, decided that certain speech was not protected.
In the case of Schneck v. the United States, Charles Schneck distributed pamphlets that said to disobey the draft but only through peaceful means. In the leaflets, Schneck argued that the draft violated the thirteenth amendment by forcing involuntary servitude upon the young men of the country. The thirteenth amendment states that [...] Involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States [...]. Schneck wrote, This is tyrannical power in its worst form. It gives control over the life and death of the individual to a few men. While Schnecks leaflets opposed the government, they are protected by the last phrase of the first amendment, Schneck had a right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. But, Schnecks audience was the American people, to provoke thought and uphold civil liberty, not violence. As Schneck said, If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or disparage rights which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain. Likewise, Debs explained his concern about the draft in a public speech. Debs wrote, I must be extremely careful, prudent, as to what I say, and even more careful and prudent as to how I say it. Debs recognized the danger of a dissenting opinion, but he was willing to face the consequences, yet, as his speech was not inciting riot or violence, it is protected by freedom of speech.
In the case of Abrams v. the United States, two leaflets were written that denounced the sending of American troops to Russia and advocated for the cessation of the production of weapons to be used against Soviet Russia. While the Supreme Court decided that these pamphlets were treasonous, a dissenting opinion came from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. He said, "Only the emergency that makes it immediately dangerous to leave the correction of evil counsels to time warrants making any exception to the sweeping command, 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.'" According to him, the leaflets did not cause clear and present danger. While Abrams opinions are protected under freedom of speech, his critical writing of the United States action in Russia was considered felonious under the unconstitutional Espionage Acts.
The Espionage Acts, while intended to prevent The insidious methods of internal hostile activities. according to President Woodrow Wilson, in reality, unconstitutionally abridged the right to freedom of speech. It makes sense that in order to focus on the war, internal trifles and opposition from within the country must be stifled, yet the Espionage Acts went too far, causing legitimate criticisms of the government such as in the Abrams v. United States case, to be considered seditious. According to the Supreme Court, Abrams violated section three, title one of the Espionage Act, the court claimed that Abrams "intended to incite, provoke and encourage resistance to the United States [...]"
So, to learn from these cases, it can be seen that the Supreme Court should very careful when making laws that abridge the freedom of speech. The illegality of speech spins on the idea of clear and present danger. It is clear that these cases were not clear and present danger. None of the aforementioned three cases regarding voicing a critical opinion the government of the United States are comparable to falsely shouting Fire! in a crowded theatre. This is Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes comparison of some of the only speech that is not permitted under the First Amendment.

PART ONE
The 1968 Democratic Convention began as our national anthem played. Carl Albert, leader of the proceedings, stood to honor our country along with the other delegates. Some of the protesters who came to demonstrate, namely Abbie Hoffman, came with complicated feelings towards our anthem. A proponent of peace, Hoffman gave the peace hand motion as the Convention commenced. This juxtaposition between delegates and protestors, symbolic of their differing views, was about to be unleashed.
	Mayor Richard Daley followed the anthem with his welcome to the American people and his thoughts on civil unrest, law and order, and foreign affairs. After his welcome, I was allowed to ask him a couple of questions regarding his speech. Upon inquiring about his stance on the war in Vietnam he replied that My ideas are not exactly in one spot. Im still open to options such as escalation, maintaining the status quo, or de-escalation. All in service to peace. Which one of these routes Daley decides to pursue in his running we have yet to see on the second day of this convention.
	The next speech of the morning came from vice president Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey spoke to urge the American people to stay calm in this time of civil unrest. When questioned about the ever-growing protests and riots, he claimed that if chosen, he would Do what is good for the American people. By doing so he believes that They will stop protesting. In this reporters opinion, from what Ive witnessed in the streets of Chicago and all around the United States, positivity alone wont quell the rampant unrest. This opinion is shared with some of the protesters I got to hear from after the mornings events. 
In reaction to the words of the delegates this morning, Bella Abzug, wearing a voluminous hat per usual, made it clear that she and the other protestors were less than pleased, as they seek a complete withdrawal and de-escalation [from Vietnam]. In addition to Ms. Abzug, Hoffman, sporting a wonderful tie-dye tee-shirt, also took issue with the vague and indirect words of the delegates this morning. Hoffman felt that the gap between the reality of the delegates and the reality of the common people couldnt be wider. Their inability to relate to the lives of the average American was overwhelmingly clear.
	Yet another perspective of the mornings proceedings was that of Bobby Seale, from the black activist group, The Black Panthers. He appeared to be woefully disappointed with the lack of focus on the lives of black Americans. And, more than just lack of focus, he stated that while the delegates never explicitly mention the suppression of Black voices, their policy and outlook on the convention stifle the black opinion. Keep an eye out for more ideas from Seale later as well be getting the full scoop from him in a separate interview. 
Similarly, in final thoughts and reactions from protestors, Lavin urged that there was too much police presence. Well see how this plays out as the protestors grow increasingly desperate to have their voices heard. For the time being, Dellinger concurred with the aforementioned points. We hope to hear more on his goals and opinions in the coming days of the convention.
PART TWO
Tensions already rising, the delegates and protestors dispersed into their respective groups to reconvene after discussion of the mornings events. The protestors, obviously disgruntled by the reluctance of the delegates to confront the most pressing issues up for debate left to discuss and plan. The delegates now began to vote on and solidify the platform on which they would be chosen to run on come November. Below is a breakdown of the policy decisions of the delegates:
DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM 1968
Criminal Justice: Mayor Daley, attempting to act with directness, calls for additional funding for criminal courts and other bodies that aid to control crime.
War on Poverty: Humphrey reiterates earlier points assuring that ALL Americans will be able to live up to their full potential when he increases spending on the War on Poverty. The result of which being food stamps and other support programs to fill the bellies of Americas families
Civil Rights: Kennedy reluctant to speak on civil rights but assures his involvement in issues related to Vietnam. Well see this in the coming days of the convention. Albert talks about civil rights saying that he will not look for problems where they might not be. Criminal justice funding will help protect those facing injustice. Daley reminds us of Federal agencies in place to protect the liberties of the Civil Rights Act. In addition, he fears a bias of federal investigations and therefore leaves it up to the states themselves. He says this is not the federal governments place to step in, and feels that the issue of civil rights has been dealt with to the extent needed
Infrastructure: Daley refers to the infrastructure plan as An idea ALL Americans can get behind  as it aims to increase spending on projects such as highways, railroads, and other amenities. He believes his policies will Uplift all of America by helping the working man and the businessman both.
PROTESTORS COME AWAY DISSATISFIED BY DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
	
As the delegates present the policy platform on which they will run, the protestors made their voices heard. Conducting a march to raise awareness of their cause, the protestors took to the streets raising their fists to the sky refusing to accept a neutral stance. Mayhem ensued despite Daleys assurance that no neutral stance has been taken. While politicians urge that they plan on being direct with the people, Abzug takes challenge. This reporter hopes to get to the root of Mr. Humphreys plans to quell the growing uncertainty from the protestors.
	
Tensions rise from both sides as Daley attempts to console the onlookers by condescendingly reminding them that the protestors are but a small batch of protestors. They are not representative of the country's values and the entirety of its people. Per usual, Hoffman retaliates scathingly stating that the government isnt for us, it never will be. This convention is a lie. As we can see, both sides are in stark disagreement at this time. To illustrate his point, Hoffman proceeds to present pigasus as a candidate for president. Now, for the first time in the convention, we get to hear a public announcement from Kenney as he takes offense from Hoffmans audacity to label the convention, and by extension the government itself, All a lie. With such a politically involved family, this comment really hit home for Kennedy.
	Amidst the chaos, it is broadcast that:
THE POLICE TRIED TO ARREST ABBIE HOFFMAN. THE ATTEMPT HAS FAILED. ABBIE IS AT LARGE
	This action of arrest appeared to do nothing to silence the voices of the protestors. In conversation with Hoffman after the incident, he freely referred to the government and the policy system as An agent of oppression. While this arrest may deter some, Hoffman states that [Hes] been arrested before, and [hell] do it again! [Hell come out here and say what [he] want[s] to say! Oh, the power of words! Abzug feels far from satisfied with the policy platform and the delegates reaction to the protest spotting the contradiction in their words. They preached for democracy, yet they appear to be quite threatened by just words. Seale brings up neglect for the black voice and the fact that the politicians seem to be addressing issues such as transportation and infrastructure to shift the focus from the more dire issue of civil rights and education of black youth. More on Seales goal and opinions to come. In agreement, Dellinger states that the platform of the delegates Contradicts the ideas of freedom, equality, and liberty for all. We hope to hear more from him on why he feels this way
In conclusion, at the end of a long day of debate and protest, the chasm between the values of the
delegates and values of the protestors could not be wider. In the coming days, the delegates get their chance to appeal to the American people. And, by the looks of it now, they have a great deal of work to do.

PART ONE
	
Day two of the convention begins as convention chair, Carl Albert, leads the pledge of allegiance. Delegates stand to pay their respects to their country whilst some protestors refrain from doing so. Wounds opened on the first day of convention leave both the delegates and protestor on edge as the mornings speeches begin.
	For the first time at this convention, we get to hear Mr. Ted Kenneys perspectives. While he refrained from offering his thoughts on civil rights, a real shock to the protestors who hoped hed represent them, he now speaks on issues of foreign affairs in Vietnam. Grabbing the attention of the delegates and onlookers in the convention hall alike, he states, referring to Vietnam, that he is personally shocked at the lack of progress we are making in the region. The systemic mismanagement leads him to conclude that at this point, it is impossible to win this war, and that a policy of de-escalation appears to be the only option. Following Kennedys speech, Mayor Daley assures no escalation in Vietnam. More on this debate later on. Next, Daley makes a subdued, yet patronizing remark targeted at myself, writer William S. Burroughs of Esquire Magazine, to take full advantage of [my] press credentials to attend the private meetings of the delegates. I, therefore, did this despite the protestor-centric focus of my character. I can only hope that Mr. Daley is satisfied.
	To conclude the speeches of the morning, Mr. Connolly shared his strong views on the issue of Vietnam. In this crucial stage of the war, he claimed that to back down from Vietnam now is cowardice. He views the war in Vietnam as a larger issue, the fight against the spread of communism. With this belief, he accuses the protestors of being undercover communists themselves. When questioned for further information on this claim, Connolly replied by saying that opposition to the war is communistic propaganda. 
	To shift away from the formalities of the convention hall where the delegates shared their thoughts this morning, we now hear from Mr. Bobby Seale, profiled in the Esquire Magazine just days before. Seale reiterates the fact that to achieve the peace the delegates speak of, we must first dismantle our racist government. The policies must focus on black oppression first and then, and only then, can we focus on the more superficial issues of infrastructure. Seale feels that steps could have been taken in the direction of civil rights, yet the delegates voted to represent a platform that focuses on other issues. To conclude his speech, he threatens that if no accountability is taken, you will hear our cries in the streets. 
	Protestors and delegates alike are tense as they disperse into their respective groups to discuss, debate, and plan.
PART TWO
	
In the meeting of the delegates, impassioned deliberation ensues. This future of the democratic party rests on decisions made here. The choices regarding the war are as follows: Maintain the status quo, increase troops and force, or de-escalate the war with the withdrawal of troops. As disputes fly, the semblance of a plan begins to take form. Both Kennedy and Daley agree that the US must take a defensive stance in the war. While Daley is confident in the US troops, they have a disadvantage by not knowing the area. His rationale is that if we present as defensive, then we are seen as peacekeepers rather than warmongers. Both Connoly and Humphrey stand strong in their belief that de-escalation will only lead to increased enemy strength and power. While Daley and Kennedy urge a more peaceful approach, Humphrey feels that if they wont listen to reason, we must fight for the free world we believe in. After much deliberation, Humphrey and Connolly concede defeat. All delegates agree to no longer take an offensive stance in Vietnam, as that does nothing but perpetuate the cycle of deaths, but as Daley warns, if the Vietnamese so much as intimate an offensive, we will be back in there. This plan is to win over the hearts and minds of the American voters by creating the image of a peaceful party.
	As debate continues amongst the delegates, Esquire Magazine gets an inside look at the happenings in the protestors meet-up. Talk of a peaceful sit-in hovers in the air. Its becoming clear that they must take direct action if they are to influence the decisions made by the delegates. With a speech from Dellinger and Abzug planned for before the sit-in, the protestors feel that If [the delegates] arent going to hear our voices, [theyll] sit here until they are heard. Dellinger feels that the delegates are not representing his ideals, so hell use this peaceful demonstration to show them that they arent. The difference in approach between the protestors is just as apparent as with the delegates. While Abzug refrains from joining the sit-in, Hoffman declares that if the police force meets them with violence, then they will retaliate.
INTERVIEW: HOFFMAN WORRIES HIS BELIEFS ARE BEING MISUNDERSTOOD
	
Mr. Abbie Hoffman, worried that his beliefs were being misconstrued, contacted the Esquire Magazine. Dedicated to telling the whole story, I, Mr. Burroughs, offer you this exclusive interview with Mr. Hoffman. 
What are your beliefs, and how do you feel they are being misunderstood?
In response to this inquiry, Hoffman replied that it was quite a loaded question. Launching into his ideas about living freely and in a communal lifestyle, Hoffman said, I assume directed at the American system of government, that all people have the right to live. In a society where having fun is seen as rebellious, Hoffman seeks to have fun and disrupt things. He feels that his view on living is being oppressed not only by individual delegates at this convention but the entire American system. Constructs and realities such as laws and capitalism inhibit us from living fully. Hoffman concluded by saying that everything the delegates stand for is inherently corrupt because it serves a corrupt system.
What results do you hope for from the voting tomorrow?
	Hoffman says that hes not looking for any success from the convention tomorrow, as [his] success comes from when mayor Daley throws a temper tantrum over [their] mere presence. He plans to cause disruption and make a speech that he hopes makes them angry. Daleys reactions inspire glee in [his] heart. In all seriousness, in terms of the actual results of the convention, he states that he just hopes its not Humphrey, offering no explicit reason as to why.
If your demands arent heard and met, how will you and the yippie party respond?
	In response, Hoffman said that hell continue using absurdist tactics to gain attention. His goal is to do things to get people looking at [him]. By doing this, he hopes that people will try to understand more why hes doing it. In his opinion, while picketing and petitioning are sometimes seen as radical, but it doesnt really do anything. In contrast, what he does is interesting, its a story, theres something there. Well wait to see how these tactics play out on the third day of the convention.
Any last thoughts youd like to share with the press?
	In closing thoughts, Hoffman grounded his point, saying, that these people, the pigs, arent our real representatives. While Daley views the protestors as a loud minority, Hoffman believes that the pigs are actually the loud minority, out of touch with the American people.
PART THREE
	
The last events of the day begin as both groups reconvene having come to a consensus. Daley takes the first word as he presents the policy platform for foreign affairs that all the delegates have decided on. In summary, the American Military will stop all bombing in Vietnam as well as remove 50,000 troops from the region. While this is a mere fraction of the number of troops currently deployed there, this gives the American people hope. The democratic party seeks a peaceful solution, yet if peace is not had, we must return to the war to stop the communist spread, Daley says.
	The protestors are quite surprised by this decision to de-escalate Vietnam. Abzug feels that we are on the right track, lets bring our men home, and Dellinger concurs that they have made the right decision. Yet to show that the protestors are far from satisfied with the entirety of the democratic platform decision, Abzug, in yet another hat, confronts the delegates with a scathing speech addressing the delegates decision to abstain from the inclusion of civil rights on the platform. In this fiery speech, Abzug attacks the delegates focus on infrastructure but saying that the democratic party cares more for its trains than its people.
	Following the speeches from Abzug and Dellinger, the protestors now leave the protest zone to stage their peaceful sit-in. As they exercise their first amendment rights, Hoffman says that if we will not be heard, we will be seen! As the demonstration peacefully continues, Daley, agitated in the distraction from the convention, sets the Chicago police department on the protestors. Abzug, the proponent of peace, is hospitalized, and all the others are arrested with minor injuries. While this arrest of peaceful demonstrators takes care of the immediate issue, we can expect growing discontent from the protestors in the coming days. The protestors, jailed and hospitalized, will be released and recovered in time for the third and last day of the convention.

***VOTING TO OCCUR NEXT SESSION***?Make the Case
Although I am Asian, I am first and foremost an American. I have lived here my entire life and am proud to call it my home. As an American citizen I have interest in the Plessy v. Ferguson because I feel my rights are affected by the decision in this case. I am a resident of Louisiana who travels extensively, and I think my freedom of movement is my inalienable right. According to the Separate Car Act, any passenger insisting on going into a coach or compartment to which by race he does not belong, shall be liable to a fine of twenty-five dollars or in lieu thereof to imprisonment for a period of not more than twenty days in the parish prison. According to this law, a man named Homer Plessy could not use the white only car because he was only ? white. He was asked to vacate the car but he refused to do so. He was arrested as a result  and was eventually convicted. The argument for his conviction is the idea of separate but equal which proposes that the rights of people of different races are not violated by requiring them to travel in separate train cars. Although the 14th amendment intended to establish equality of all citizens regardless of race, the actual equality wasnt achieved in the Southern States after the civil war.  
The US faced a difficult problem of rebuilding the South ravaged by the Civil War which lasted from 1861- 1865. One of the USs goals was to rebuild the economy and integrate the South with the more economically developed Northern states. Another big challenge was dealing with the consequences of slavery and providing the former slaves with equal oportunities. This required to stop the discrimination of people on the basis of their race which was the intention of the 13th and 14th amendemnts. According to the 13th, Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, which effectively abloshed slavery. This was followed with the 14th amendment which stated that, No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In 1875, the Civil Rights Act clarified the meaning of the 14th amendment by stating that All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin. This essentially prohibited both private citizens and organizations from discriminating based on the color of ones skin. This law applied to public places such as restaurants and cinema as well as public transportation such as the railway system. Unfortunately, in the Civil Rights Cases the Supreme Court interpreted the 13th and 14th amendments in such a way that the discrimination was only prohibited for the state and not for individuals or corporations. One of the judges, Justice Joseph P. Bradley stated that The essence of the law is not to declare broadly that all persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations... but that such enjoyment shall not be subject to any conditions applicable only to citizens of a particular race or color, or who had been in a previous condition of servitude. This resulted in the Civil Rights Act being effectively nullified which led to the enactment of the Separate Car Act in the state of Louisiana along with many other similar state laws. 
This leads us back to the case of Plessy v. Ferguson in which the Separate Car Act was used to prevent Homer Plessy from traveling in the white only car. Although he was convicted in the end I would argue that the courts decision was in many ways flawed. Although railways are owned by a private company, they are inherently a monopoly. There is only one track on which the train can go, meaning it is impossible to start a private business which can rival the existing one unless an entirely new railway system is built. In my area, the railway is the only way I can travel long distances both in and out of the state. According to the 5th amendment, as a citizen of the US i cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law which includes the liberty to travel. The Separate Car Act forces the railway company to provide separate cars for black and white people, but I do not fall into either category. By the logic of the separate but equal doctrine, every race should have their own train car in order to maintain equality. As a minority, my rights are violated due to the inability of the railways to provide equality for all the other races. Therefore, the only solution is to give all citizens the liberty to travel in any car. The 14th amendment states  ...nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law which guarantees my right to travel and therefore use the railway without impediment. I believe that the Separate Car Act is a slippery slope that will only divide us as more as time goes by. As more people immigrate into this country, these laws will only prove to divide us more in a time where we should be united in one common goal of improving this country.

Mystery Metals Lab
Date: 3/24/21
Purpose: The Mystery Metals Lab aims to ascertain the identity of an unknown metal using its specific heat, determined by temperature changes of the system and surroundings.
Procedure:
1.Mass the piece of metal.
2.Make a coffee cup calorimeter and mass it.
3.Add water; re-mass the calorimeter.
4.Boil some water (enough to submerge sample). 
5.Remove the pot from the stove and place the sample of metal in the boiling water with tongs. 
6.Wait 2 minutes, then record the temperature of the water at the exact time the metal is taken out of the beaker. 
7.Record the water temperature in the cup, then add the metal to the cup (with tongs to avoid spilling). 
8.Wait until the temperature in the cup has stabilized, and record the final temp. 
Data Table:

Calculations:

Determine the average specific heat of the metal.
Determine the identity of the metal: Zinc
Conclusion: With the data recorded above and the Law of Conservation of Energy, we were able to determine the specific heat and, therefore, the mystery metals identity. While my calculated specific heat was .854, far higher than that of zinc (the real identity of my sample), that error could be attributed to a couple of different factors. First of all, the thermometer that I used wasnt digital, and therefore I had to make estimations as to what the temperature in Fahrenheit was before converting it into celsius. Secondly, the at-home balances can sometimes be finicky and not entirely accurate. These two factors are likely contributors to the error in my data.
Heat of Fusion Lab
Date: 4/2/21
Purpose: The Heat of Fusion Lab aims to ascertain the heat of fusion of ice using calorimetry and thermochemistry.
Procedure:
1.Make a coffee cup calorimeter and mass it
2.Fill the calorimeter with water and re-mass it
3.Put in the thermometer and wait for the water and thermometer to come to thermal equilibrium; then record the temperature of the water as the initial temperature
4.Record the temperature of the freezer as the temperature of ice
5.Add 2-3 ice cubes to the calorimeter
6.Stir the ice cubes and water mixture with the thermometer
7.Record the temperature of the final mixture as the final temperature before the temperature begins to rise 
8.Mass the entire calorimeter with ice and water (without the thermometer)
9.Repeat steps 1-7 for a total of three trials
Data Table:
Mass of cup (w/o water) (g)
Mass of cup (w/ water) (g)

                                *Tf is the final temperature
Calculations: 
Average Calculated Heat of Fusion = 
                                                         = 417.335J/g
Conclusion: In summary, this lab used simple materials and thermochemistry to calculate the heat of fusion of ice. While my average heat of fusion was calculated to be 417.335J/g, and the accepted value is 333J/g, we could possibly attribute errors to the escape of heat from the calorimeter during check to make sure the ice was melted. Also, my measurement of the temperature of ice may have been inaccurate because the ice came from the refrigerator door, and I measured the temperature of the freezer. 
Ethanol Burn Lab
Date: 4/5/21
Purpose: The Ethanol Burn Lab, a preliminary lab to the waste labs that follow, determined how much energy from the burning is not directly transferred to the water in the can. With a known quantity of 1,255kJ per mole of ethanol burned, we can calculate how much of that energy, the percent inefficiency, was not transferred to the water. This will be crucial in the combustion energy calculations in the Combustion Lab. 
Procedure:
1.Mass the ethanol burner and the empty aluminum can.
2.Add approximately 50 ml of tap water to the can and re-mass it so that you are able to calculate the mass of the water. 
3.Take the temperature of the water sample.
4.Using a glass stir rod through the loop of the tab in the can, set the can up so it is resting on a ring clamp above the ethanol burner. 
5.Set the burner on the ring stand, and adjust the height of the ring clamp such that the top of the wick of the ethanol burner is about 2 cm below the can.
6.Light the ethanol burner and allow it to burn for about 30 seconds. Extinguish the burner.
7.Swirl the can to make sure the water is evenly heated then quickly take the waters temperature
8.Re-mass the burner to determine the mass of ethanol burned. 
9.Try to complete 3 trials, then calculate the percent efficiency for each trial and the average of the three trials. 
Data Table:

Conclusion: My data and calculations resulted in an average of 54.29% efficiency in the energy transfer from the ethanol burner to the water in the can. These results will be instrumental in the next lab in determining how much energy was released from burning our fake human waste.
Waste Dehydration Lab
Date: 4/7/21
Purpose: The Waste Dehydration Lab aims to ascertain the mass lost per gram of wet waste as well and the amount of energy required to oven-dry a sample per gram of wet waste.
Procedure:
1.Weigh the sample of wet waste
2.Put into an oven to dry (5 days)
3.Take out and measure the mass of the sample
4.Return to oven for a second time (2 days)
5.Take out and measure mass as your final measurement

Conclusion: The amount of energy per gram of water required to vaporize the water in our sample of wet waste was 1598.47J/g.
Waste Combustion Lab
Date: 4/7/21
Purpose: The Waste Dehydration Lab aims to ascertain the amount of energy stored in dry waste via combustion and heat energy transfer.
Procedure:
1.Mass your sample of fake waste.
2.Mass the aluminum can.
3.Fill the can about halfway with water.
4.Mass the aluminum can with the water in it.
5.Take the initial temperature of the water with the digital thermometer.
6.Set waste on the paper clip stand, and adjust the height of the ring clamp such that the is about 2 cm below the can.
7.Burn the sample of waste until the flame goes out.
8.Record the final temperature of the water in the can after burning and re-mass the waste.
9.Repeat steps 1 through 7 for a total of three trials.

From where it comes I do not know.
It starts but spinning to and fro;
The line unfolds, theres magic here
The arc then changes, stretches, grows.
From in my head the line I hear
Is calm, is soothing, wracked with fear.
A mystery what shape it takes
I sit, I listen, trust my ear.
Then clear becomes the line, I quake
It came to me, but by mistake?
Enhance it, shape it, break it free
The tremolo begins to shake.

A now completed symphony,
Not by mistake, it came to me, 
Not by mistake, it came to me.
Write-up: 
1) What is the original rhyme scheme and meter?
Rhyme Scheme:
The original rhyme scheme in the poem Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost is aaba, but each stanzas a is derived from the b of the previous stanza creating this rhyme scheme: 
aaba
bbcb
ccdc
dddd
The aforementioned rhyme scheme is followed for all of the stanzas except the very last
one which had a continued end rhyme scheme.
Meter:
The meter follows an unstressed stressed pattern throughout the poem: u/u/u/u/
2) What are the poetic devices in the original?
Three of the poetic devices in the original poem are as follows:
End rhyme:
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
Repetition:
And miles to go before I sleep
And miles to go before I sleep
Alliteration:
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
3) How you have included the poetic devices in your poem?
End rhyme: 
I follow the rhyme scheme of the original poem in my recreation. For a good deal of the
rhyme, I even rhyme the same sounds as the original poem too.
Repetition:
I use repetition in the same manner as the original poem by placing it in the same part; 
repeat my last line.
Alliteration: I use alliteration at the end of the first line of my fourth stanza. This is 
identical to the original poem, but I use a different consonant sound to repeat.
The feeling lovely, splendid, see?
I use S instead of D, but they serve the same purpose.

PrePOSterous PREposterous prepostERous? Suppresssss. Suppress the preposterous. Why suppress the preposterous when the obstreperous are preposterous only to offer us options-thus, blinking in the blinding binding system. We missed our chance to take a stance, now FIST raised yet not praised for bravery. America perpetuated preposterousness in slavery. Learned nothing? No blushing with shame? Just a game no message? Clearly pained visage yet Daley to dissuade? Beaten, mistreated yet silenced with violence to allow the system to commence. Henceforth the mess will be inevitable, unforgettable yet regrettable as so many DIE. Why? Why die? Death. Life...
	Life is so short, is it not? A sport? Where tuxedoed contortionists pound gavels, not fists to fit the perceived decree of the people in need yet fail to avail the ailing for real? What is real in this world when facades are so thick they seep with the blood of innocent livescreep with the crud of duplicitous lies? Yet through it all there is power. Abused? Misused? The truth unknown. If it was, ever is or will be, undoubtedly proudly suppressed.
	In reality, totality, unscathed by frailty of human ego, we are but animals wild. Compiled together to decide, confide, deride. To ride the wave of ignorance and greed yet not heed the voices questioning those chosen, so supposedly poised. COME TOGETHER! This convention, invention of pretent-ion, is but a collection, in my retrospection, of the defect-ion of representation in this station, so high. Am I high? What does it mean to be high? What doesnt it mean? Does meaning something mean anything at all? Or, at the fall, are we all not so tall? Tall this was but a tale. The tail end making those who prevailed quite pale so pale. Not even there in the room.
	This room where it happened, the crap-end of an era of scares, climbing stairs to nowhere. Yet, somewhere at the same time. Its game time for delegates, so delicate they cant deal with it. The voices and choices of others that smother them with confusion. In response? Forceful diffusion.
Theres a bird outside my window. Its flying, not dying, not even trying to thrive just surviving. America is doing neither. The only option is to enjoy life, not deploy strife. Strife grips the edge of a boat, once floating, now gloating yet sinking as its not thinking of evolving just devolving into chaos. The cha-os, cause, of the need for preposterous-ness.

Social expulsion is not an effective form of punishment.
If we look at the current political climate in The United States, one may notice a degree of hostility between those who hold differing viewpoints. This hostility stems from a desire for mass conformation to the commonly held beliefs in the community. Using social expulsion as a form of punishment is far from a new concept, and one can draw upon historical references to further their understanding of this topic. Social exclusion as a form of punishment is when specific people are shunned from a society or community in order to punish or change their views. Readers can see examples of this occurring in both The Scarlet Letter (Nathaniel Hawthorn) and The Crucible (Arthur Miller). In both The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter specific characters experience social isolation as a result of straying from their societies social norms. In the case of The Crucible, a play written by Arthur Miller in 1953, readers can see those who do not assent to the belief of the witchcraft accusations are faced with social expulsion and even death. In contrast, in The Scarlet Letter, which was written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1850, readers see the protagonist (Hester) experiencing social expulsion and mockery as punishment for her sin (adultery). In both of these scenarios, using social exclusion as punishment is not effective because in the end of both these books the punished characters either die or they are viewed in an almost angelic light. Furthermore, we also know that the intent behind the social expulsion was confirmation, which was not achieved. With this information we can draw the conclusion that social expulsion is not an effective form of punishment.
If given a cursory glance, one might not notice that The Scarlet Letter shows that social expulsion is not an effective form of punishment, but if the text is meticulously analyzed the presence of this topic will become clearer. In the early stages of the plot in The Scarlet Letter, members of the town strongly advocate to remove Hester from society as she has broken the norms by committing adultery.  Readers can see this directly occurring in the following quote: This woman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die. Is there not law for it? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book (49). Now that Hesters social isolation has been established we can notice how the way people view her begins to change, which conflicts with the previous goal of punishing her.  As a seamstress, Hester makes clothes for everyone (including donating it to the poor).  As a result of showing benevolence towards complete strangers and acting as a benefactor towards them, Hester begins to be described in an angelic manner. For example, in the following quote they are referencing The Scarlet Letter (her punishment) as the sign of an angel instead of the sign of an adulterer. But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night? A great red letter in the sky,--the letter A,--which we interpret to stand for Angel'' (138). In this quote they are directly referring to a meteor, but the parallels between the meteor and the scarlet letter lead one to the conclusion that the meteor is a reference to Hester. We know this because both the meteor and the scarlet letter are described as red and the letter A. Furthermore, we have previously established that the scarlet letter is a big part of Hester's identity and her existence in the Puritian society. The fact that the meteor is included was very intentional, we can assume that it is in place to draw readers attention to that quote and for them to notice the similarities between it and the scarlet letter that Hester wears. This is significant because it shows that even though the stated goal was to punish Hester through social isolation, that this was ineffective. This begs the question of to what extent social expulsion is effective when attempting to punish someone. 
In The Crucible, one of the primary characters (John Procter) attempts to reason with the townspeople and revoke any false accusations that had been made. In response he gets excommunicated, which is very extreme considering that religion is held in high esteem in their community. Furthermore, he is shunned by many members of the community. When Procter gets excommunicated very few people attend, as seen in the following quote. "It cannot be forgot, sir, that when I summoned the congregation for John Proctor's excommunication there were hardly thirty people coming to hear it. That speaks of discontent, I think [...]" This shows that the members of the towns viewpoints of procter have changed, and now instead of viewing him as a friend they are averse towards. Ultimately John Proctor is accused of witchcraft and given a choice. He either can stray from his morality and lie, affirming that these accusations are true, or his life will be in jeopardy.  Ultimately, readers will find that John Proctor chooses to preserve his dignity, as seen in the following quote. Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! Because I lie and sign myself to lies! Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name! This quote clearly shows that John Proctor has made the difficult choice to sacrifice his life in order to preserve his name. In the closing of the book he is hanged for not admitting to practicing witchcraft. These concepts converge to show readers that social expulsion is an ineffective form of punishment because the goal of the town was not his death, in contrast it was mass confirmation to the societal ideals. The fact that killing John Proctor was seen as necessary by the town shows readers that expelling him from society did not work, as he never conformed to the belief of witchcraft. 
Over the course of The Crucible, multiple characters are hanged for not conforming to societal norms and affirming that they did in fact participate in witchcraft. Another example of this occurring is with Rebecca Nurse. In the primary stages of the novel readers can notice Rebecca Nurse attempting to reason with the townspeople regarding the witchcraft allegations, as seen in the following quote verbatim: "I have seen them all through their silly seasons, and when it come on them they will run the Devil bowlegged keeping up with their mischief. I think she'll wake when she tires of it. A child's spirit is like a child, you can never catch it by running after it; you must stand still, and, for love, it will soon itself come back" (27). After further scrutinization of the text, readers will notice that Rebecca Nurse is clearly attempting to reason with the members of the town, and express to them that Abigail's behavior is not witchcraft, but typical defiant teenage behavior. In later stages of the books readers see Parris, Danforth and Hawthorne discussing Rebecca and the other accused members. This can be seen in the following quote. Hear me. Rebecca has not given me a word this three month since she came. [...] and he pleads with them, confess their crimes and save their lives. (116) This quote shows readers that those in power are telling people that if they dont confess to a crime that they will be killed. This, along with alienating those who stray from the popular belief, is clearly a form of attempting to coerce them into confirmation. In the end, Rebecca Nurse is hung as punishment for not confessing to witchcraft. The fact that the original tactics (social exclusion) was not successful in convincing Rebecca Nurse to conform to the largely accepted beliefs of the town, continues to further the precedent that social expulsion is an ineffective form of punishment. 
Both The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter are frequently read by students in highschool. If we were to look at both these stories one may wonder what lessons can be drawn from these books that can be applied to current events. After looking at characters from both The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible one ascertain that social expulsion is not an effective form of punishment. This knowledge can be applicable to current day-to-day life. It is more important than ever to be unified as a nation, and remembering that expelling someone from society is not effective and will ultimately backfire is critical. It is important to provide room for a diverse range of opinions in a society. We have seen three clear examples of what happens if that is not the case in these two books.  Ultimately the message one can draw from these stories is that despite any discrepancies one may have with your own beliefs, that socially isolating in order to coerce them into submission will not result in them conforming to your own ideas/ beliefs. Furthermore, when attempting to express one's beliefs to another, viewing them as an adversary and holding malevolent intent is an incorrect pathway to follow. To reiterate a final time, one can take the lessons drawn from The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter, and apply them to their own lives. Instead of taking the pathway of punishment for differing beliefs, use acceptance and listen to others. If everyone was to take these lessons and implement them into their daily lives the positive changes that we would see will be massive.

   Con la llegada de conquistadores, inmediatamente la gente indgena fue considerar peor de los espaoles (en los ojos de los espaoles).

How Moral Transgressions are Viewed in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter
Lady Justice is blind because seeing makes her judgements biased. Justice only sees the crimes committed, and does not perceive the people who committed those transgressions. Perceiving someone causes their transgression to be more or less believable, and as such makes the judgement on that transgression biased for or against that person. Someone who has stolen a cookie from the cookie jar will be suspected of stealing a cookie if one is found missing from that jar. That person has been perceived as committing a transgression, but only because they previously transgressed by stealing a cookie from the jar. However, a person who consistently admonishes everyone who steals cookies from the jar wont be suspected when a cookie is stolen. That person wont be suspected because they are perceived as being unable to commit the transgression of stealing the cookie. This difference in judgement based on perception is applicable to both real life and fiction. For example, in the book The Scarlet Letter, and the play The Crucible, both of which are set in puritan Massachusetts, authority figures make judgements based on their perceptions of supposed transgressors, regardless of whether or not a tangible transgression was even committed. In The Scarlet Letter, the protagonist Hester is given the scarlet letter instead of death, and Dimmesdale, her paramour is still seen as a saint despite admitting to adultery, a sin. In The Crucible, Danforth, a judge, believes that anyone contradicting what he says has committed a crime, and punishes them as such. Social outcasts in The Crucible are perceived as witches with very little evidence. The punishments of those who transgressed in The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible are based solely on the perception of the transgressor by the authority figures, not the transgression itself.
	The perception of Hesters condition by the authority figures in The Scarlet Letter causes her to receive the Scarlet Letter instead of death. The authority figures perceive Hester as a woman who was easily tempted to sin by her situation, so they give her clemency. When Hester is being released from prison, some townspeople outside the prison comment that This woman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die. Is there not law for it? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book(Hawthorne 49). Here Hester ought to die as there is a law for it[...] both in the Scripture and statute-book. However, Hester is receiving the benevolent punishment of the Scarlet letter instead of death despite violating both a law in the town and a law in the Scripture. If Hester should receive death, why doesnt she? When Chillingworth first enters the town, he is told this about why Hester was given the Scarlet Letter,  Now sir, our Massachusetts magistracy, bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair, and doubtless was strongly tempted to her fall; - and that, moreover, as it most likely, her husband may be at the bottom of the sea.(Hawthorne 58) Hester was given the Scarlet Letter as a punishment instead of death because she was strongly tempted to fall, and that her husband may be at the bottom of the sea. Instead of death, the Scarlet Letter represents the shame Hester holds for committing adultery, as is said by Governor Bellingham in this quote, Woman, it is thy badge of shame! (Hawthorne 98) Hester is given the Scarlet Letter because the authority figures view her as being strongly tempted to fall, and as such change their punishment of her transgression from death to the Scarlet Letter. 
	The Authority figures perception of Dimmesdale also causes them to deny reality when he transgresses. At the end of the book, Dimmesdale reveals that he was the one who committed adultery with Hester. However, nobody in the town thinks poorly of him after his reveal and subsequent death. In the epilogue of the book, the narrator states  It is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons,[..] by their report, had his dying words acknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any, the slightest connection, on his part, with the guilt for which Hester Prynne had so long worn the Scarlet Letter. According to these highly respectable witnesses.(Hawthorne 223-224) The description of the witnesses as highly respectable shows that they are authority figures because when authority figures are together, they are often referred to as respectable. Normally these stately authority figures would condemn anyone who publicly admitted to adultery and then died, but in Dimmesdales case the authority figures still view him as a saintly figure. Throughout the book, the narrator states that Dimmesdale is viewed in a very high regard by both the authority figures and the townspeople. For example, when describing Dimmesdale, the narrator says His fame, though still on its upward slope, already overshadowed the soberer reputations of his fellow-clergymen, eminent as several of them were,(Hawthorne 123) and that Mr. Dimmesdale, the young divine,[...]was considered by his more fervent admirers, as little less than a heaven-ordained apostle.(Hawthorne 105) Both of these quotes show that Dimmesdale was not only considered close to a heaven-ordained apostle, but was also the most famous clergyman at his young age. This perception of Dimmesdale did not change after the adultery, with the narrator saying He had told his hearers that he was altogether vile, a viler companion of the vilest, the worst of sinners, an abomination, a thing of unimaginable iniquity;[...]They heard it all, and did but reverence him the more. [...] The godly youth! said they among themselves. The saint on earth!(Hawthorne 125) Even after Dimmesdale starts calling himself a sinner, he is still extolled as the saint on earth, and his fame continues to rise. Due to his perception as a holy figure, and his incredible fame, no punitive action was taken despite Dimmesdale admitting to adultery. 
	In The Crucible, Danforth, a judge, perceives anyone challenging the narrative that there are witches in Salem in a negative light. This perception causes Danforth to disregard actual evidence against the trials, and instead causes him to support Abbys rampant unsupported accusations of witchcraft. Danforth does this because he is averse to showing any sign of the witchcraft trials possibly being in the wrong. When Danforth is about to hang several prominent figures for witchcraft, he is petitioned to stop by multiple people. Danforth then responds by saying Now hear me, and beguile yourselves no more. I will not receive a single plea for pardon or postponement. Them that will not confess will hang. [...] Postponement now speaks a floundering on my part; reprieve or pardon must cast doubt upon the guilt of them that died till now.(Miller 119) Danforth will not postpone the hanging because that speaks to a floundering on his part, and that reprieve or pardon must cast doubt upon the guilt of them that died till now. Danforth does not want to be seen as wavering on the issue of witchcraft, and as such is taking an indomitable position against any who oppose the complete guilt of those accused of witchcraft. For example, when told that there is fear of the court in Salem, Danforth responds with Then there is a prodigious guilt in the country. (Miller 91) Danforth immediately associates any negative feeling towards the court as an admission of guilt. He perceives these people going against the court as if they have already transgressed in some way, and as such should be punished. Due to this perception, Danforth uses his powers as judge to throw Giles in jail for contempt of court rather than listen to his accusation against Putnam, and makes an incredibly biased judgement in favor of Abby when there is no real proof of witchcraft. When Abby screams about there being a bird present that is somehow harming her, Danforth not only intimidates Mary Warren by saying You have seen the Devil, you have made a compact with Lucifer, have you not?(Miller 108) while she is being accused of witchcraft by the other girls, but also refusing to listen to Hale when Hale says I see nothing, Your Honor!(Miller 109) in regards to the bird. Danforth listens to what Abby, who supports the idea that the witch trials are real, says, but won't listen to Hale, who goes against the veracity of the trials, when Hale contradicts Abbys point. Danforth also intimidates Mary Warren, who is trying to prove that the girls have been telling lies about there being witches, by suggesting that she is a witch as well. Danforth does nothing of this sort to Abby or the other girls when they claim someone is a witch. Danforths perception of those who go against the court as already transgressing and those who go with the court as innocent causes him to punish innocent people as if they had committed a crime, and causes him to believe the words of anyone who goes with the court, regardless of whether or not those people are lying or have transgressed in some way themselves. 
	The original people implicated in practicing witchcraft in The Crucible are all perceived as social outcasts, and this perception causes them to be the first people accused of witchcraft. When Parris, Hathorne and Danforth are talking about the postponement of the hangings of Rebecca Nurse and John Proctor, Parris tells Hathorne Judge Hathome - it were another sort that hanged till now. Rebecca Nurse is no Bridget that lived three year with Bishop before she married him. John Proctor is not Isaac Ward that drank his family to ruin.(Miller 117) Parris then tells Danforth I would to God it were not so, Excellency, but these people have great weight yet in the town.(Miller 118) The authority figures, namely Parris, Danforth, and Hathorne, perceived the earlier accused as witches because they didnt have great weight yet in the town. Not having this great weight means that those outcasts were disreputable, or not held in high esteem by most people. This lack of influence is due to the actions of the early accused, which were perceived as bad. Parris equates Bridget living three year with Bishop before she married him,  to Issac Ward that drank his family to ruin. These actions are examples of social transgressions, or actions which cause the person committing them to be seen as a social outcast. These social outcasts are perceived witches because they have already gone against society once with their social transgressions. Their social transgressions make perceiving the social outcasts as witches easier because committing witchcraft is also going against the society.
	There are vehement examples of perception being the only thing that matters when making a judgement in real life as well. During the Vietnam War, a platoon of American soldiers slaughtered 500 South Vietnamese citizens, which is a war crime. 25 people were convicted once this was found out. However, every person who took part in the slaughter was given a shorter sentence than they should have, and even that shortened time remaining was waived, because all of the convicts were released early. These murderers werent perceived as war criminals, for they were in Vietnam fighting for their country. There are also examples of people receiving much harsher punishments solely because of how they are perceived, and not because of what they may or may not have done. In 2021 in Virginia, A black lieutenant was pepper sprayed, dragged from his car, and handcuffed by police officers solely because he was black. The reason given for this treatment was because his temporary license plate was improperly set up. The plate itself was actually correctly set up. Regardless, the lieutenant should not have been pepper sprayed, abused, and handcuffed for a single traffic violation. The lesson these texts and examples can teach us about addressing perceived transgressions in 2021 is to both look at the context around the transgression and the transgression itself. The personality of the person who supposedly committed the transgression does not matter. As these texts show, even those who appear to be a saint on earth can commit sin.?Kyle Gustafson

Final Reflection
The digital art form I enjoy the most is photography. Some of my favorites activities are traveling and being in nature, both of which pair very well with photography. While I dont have a good camera, I love learning about how to take the best photos I can with the tools I have. Part of this is the actual composition of the photo, how I take it at the time, and part of it is editing them afterwards. I used to think of editing as cheating in a way, but now I realized that it is simply bringing back the detail that the camera did not come close to capturing. I loved taking photos before I took this course, and I like it even better afterwards.
	The forms of digital art that I had to learn the most for were probably video/audio and stop motion. This is because I have practically no experience with filming, aside from painfully cringy iMovies from when I was a kid. Knowing the elements of photography made it easier, but I still experienced much trial and error with positioning, composition, and other elements. 
	The digital art forms that are less appealing to me are graphic design and stop motion animation. For graphic design, I dont enjoy always thinking about rules such as balance, direction, hierarchy, and more. Photography appeals to me partly because of the abstract nature of it; a good photo is of something that inspires you, or you think is cool. In contrast, graphic design has some abstract elements, but there are many rules you need to follow to have good graphic design. As for stop motion animation, I just dont really enjoy the somewhat tedious monotony of taking picture after slightly different picture (okay, maybe Im being just a bit dramatic). 
	While I dont particularly enjoy graphic design, the project I am most proud of is my personal branding portfolio. One reason for this is that I worked very hard on it to get a result that I felt represented my personality, and I feel that I succeeded. Another reason is that I learned a lot about graphic design, whether or not I completely enjoy it.
	I think that the digital media skill I will take most advantage of in the future is photography, because I love doing it. However, other skills, particularly personal branding and graphic design, will most likely come in handy later in my education and career. For these reasons, I am very glad I learned the skills.?Atomic Absorption and Emission are part of the action of when an electron moves around the electron cloud of an atom in a specific way. An electron generally resides in a specific place of the atom in relation to the nucleus, we call this the electrons Ground State. But if an electron absorbs energy, it gets excited and moves to a different place in the atom, and we call the place it ends up its Excited State. An electron moves from its Ground State to its Excited State when it absorbs energy, that action is Atomic Absorption. Then, when an electron moves back from its Excited State to its Ground State it releases energy in the form of light, this action is called Atomic Emission. 
A flame test is the process of putting certain chemicals in contact with flames, and using the flame color to identify certain components of the chemical. When the chemicals come in contact with the flames, the fire excites the electrons in the atoms of certain elements which leads to the process of Atomic Absorption. Then when the electrons go back to their ground state in the process of Atomic Emission, energy in the form of light is released, which changes the color of the flame. The color of the flame is dependent on the amount of energy released in Atomic Emission, which is based on the distance between the ground state and the excited state of an electron. In different atoms, the distance an electron travels from its ground state to its excited state differs, and the distance can be measured in how many energy levels it has traveled. The color of light released, and thus the flame color is based on the amount of energy released and the amount of energy levels an electron is moving, when it returns to its ground state. This is why for different chemicals, the fire is different colors.
When in contact with a flame, different elements burn different colors, copper makes the flame green, sodium orange, barium yellow, calcium red. Other elements make different colors, like potassium which makes the flame a purple or lilac color, strontium which makes the flame red, and lithium which makes the flame pink. When the three different flavors of Gatorade were burned (Riptide Rush, Lemon-Lime, and Arctic Blitz), they all made the flame appear orange. And from our flame tests with the ionic solutions, we know that sodium compounds, when in contact with a flame, make the flame appear orange. Which is why we can hypothesize that the ionic compound that the three flavors contained was one that involves sodium.\
In our flame tests we found that the element copper makes the flame green, sodium makes it orange, barium makes it yellow, calcium and strontium make it red, potassium makes the flame a light purple color, and that lithium makes the flame pink. And from our flame tests with the Gatorade drinks we found that all three flavors of Gatorade that we tested made the flame appear orange. Because of our observations of the different flame tests with ionic compounds and the information we could conclude about certain elements from them, we can infer what element was in the Gatorade drinks. Because we learned that ionic compounds that included sodium made the flame appear orange like the Gatorade did, we can make an educated guess that whatever ionic compound or compounds that the three Gatorade drinks had in them included sodium.

Our experiences and the way we are raised often create our prejudices and define our moral transgressions. We can learn from The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter that those who exercise the authority to punish moral transgressions should be aware of their own moral blindness. As humans, we should be weary of the certainty of our own rightness of our own values that can create prejudice and intolerance which can affect the way we treat others who are different from ourselves. In extreme cases, we can treat others less than human because of our own moral blindness. We can see this in the religious leaders of the play and book where they are given absolute power by the church. This intransigent power corrupts them, making them uncompromising and closed-minded; their dogmatic faith makes them believe they are doing the right thing when in reality they end up doing more harm than good. They derive their authority from the townpeoples fear of the devil and divine retribution. Moreover, both of these societies are morally blind when it comes to the treatment of women and the imbalances of power. The punishments are usually placed upon women, and these women only get a say in things if their husbands advocate for them.  In 2021, those who are given power must be placed under limitations from the sources of their authority. Their authority must come from the consent of those over whom they exercise power-- unlike Puritan Salem/England, that power must not come from fear or torture, but from the reason and integrity of the individual.
As we look at the moral transgressions defined in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter -- witchcraft and adultery -- we view ourselves as enlightened because we live in a society that is not controlled by religious dogmatism--as separation of church and state is implied in the Bill of Rights. We find that these Puritan moral transgressions are risible in a sense because it seems ridiculous to us today that someone would get hanged for being accused of witchcraft, or be publicly shamed for committing adultery. In The Crucible, we can see those in power -- Danforth, Hawthorne, Parris -- having an indomitable belief of righteousness when in reality, they are blinded by their rigid faith. In Act One (an overture), Arthur Miller makes a statement about Puritan societys dogmatism and religious fanaticism: They believed, in short, that they held in their steady hands the candle that would light the world. We have inherited this belief, and it has helped and hurt us (5 Miller). Danforth and Hale are so convinced that they are doing the right thing by rooting out witches, to the point where they were hanging innocent people. Their candle that would light the world was the tragic event of the Salem witch trials hoping to cleanse the town and light the world. In the end, the witch trials do more harm than good, letting suspicion and personal vengeance run the town rampant. We can also see this certainty of rightness in The Scarlet Letter as Chillingworth tortures Dimmesdale, justifying the punishment as divine retribution. This diabolical agent had the Divine permission, for a season, to burrow into the clergymans intimacy, and plot against his soul (112 Hawthorne). Chillingworth is blinded by the fact that he believes if he exposes Dimmesdales secret of adultery, he would be doing good for the community; he tortures Dimmesdale excessively to the point where Chillingworths motive changes to personal vengeance. When we look at the history of America, there are many instances in which we believe we are doing the right thing when in reality we are doing more harm. American exceptionalism (or white savior complex) is a great example of this as we colonized and committed genocide against the Native Americans. Our moral blindness predominantly applies today when it comes to the issues of racism and discrimination.
Power tends to corrupt. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Lord Acton. Humans are venal, so when people are given power, they usually end up being corrupted by it, but absolute power will definitely be abused and corrupted as it can prevent us from seeing the options that will best benefit society; this absolute power contributes to our moral blindness because pride and certainty of rightness averts us from reflecting upon our actions when offered this type of power. In these two narratives, we often see those who are given power ending up corrupted by it. In a theocracy, their (people with power often supported by the church, i.e. priests and magistrates) legitimacy usually stems from the consent of the governed and fear within the congregation. Those in positions of power create a narrative to keep their authority by instilling fear within the community.  Parris, for example, is given intransigent power by the church and controls the town with the fear of the devil. When Proctor is discussing with Reverend Hale about Elizabeth, Proctors wife, Proctor questions the power of Parris. Hale then responds by saying I must say it, Mr.Proctor; that is not for you to decide. The mans ordained, therefore the light of God is in him. (62 Miller). Parris was officious and given intransigent power simply because he was ordained; therefore, no one should question his authority. Not being able to question the legitimacy and the authority of the officials of the town shows how power corrupts. Those who are able to define and punish moral transgressions should not be corrupted as it can make the situation worse. In The Scarlet Letter, we can see Dimmesdales intransigence as he refuses to be Pearls father and admit that he had committed adultery. His intransigent power prevents him from revealing his sin to the church and repenting. He feels as if he cannot abandon his guise of this righteous and holy minister because of the power he was granted. I should long ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness, and shown myself to mankind as they will see me at the judgement-seat (167 Hawthorne). Dimmesdale has a polluted conscience from the power given to him by the church which prevents him from revealing his sin of adultery for seven years. He struggles to see that this sin has corrupted his soul and he continues to lie to himself and his congregation. Today, we must be aware of those whom we entrust power to and the weight of that power. We should not choose future leaders based on their standing within society, but because of their integrity and their unfeigned capacity to show tolerance, compassion, and clemency.  
Women are often held reprehensible and left to carry the burden of these punishments placed upon them by magistrates and religious officials. Puritan society depicted in these two books show how women are disregarded as second class citizens. Also, none of the women in these rigidly sexist and patriarchal societies had the power of Dimmesdale or Danforth. Abigail in The Crucible had the power she had only because she was backed by the powerful men of the town -- Danforth, Hawthorne, Parris, and Hale. When she goes around accusing women of witchcraft, no one questions the legitimacy of it. Even Rebecca Nurse is implicated of witchcraft, a saint not capable of causing harm to anyone, and barely any of the people with power believed she was innocent. Proctor and Elizabeths relationship is another example of the patriarchy as Proctor expects Elizabeth to be submissive to him. The stage directions portray her cautiousness and how diffident she is around Proctor She is watching him from the table as he stands there absorbing the night, It is as though she would speak but cannot. Instead, now, she takes up his plate and glass and fork and goes with them to the basin(49 Miller). When interacting with her husband, all she hopes to do is please him. The few times she decides to speak up, she chooses her words carefully, making sure she does not anger Proctor. Nathaniel Hawthornes portrayal of women differs a bit from Arthur Millers, as women in The Scarlet Letter are given the burden of redeeming the sin of the world.  Be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty, and mans hard law, that Hester Prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellow-mortal was guilty like herself. (79 Hawthorne). Hester wore her scarlet letter on her chest as a reminder of her sin, guilt, and triumph -- represented through the deft golden embroidery around the scarlet letter. Pearl was also a symbol of the redemption of humankinds sin while being an outcast to society. The magistrates and religious leaders of these Puritan communities were blinded by their goal of punishing moral transgressions that they did not realize the imbalances of power when it came to women. Even today, we have not been able to fully address the issues of equality in America because of our stereotypes and the extant patriarchal expectations of women. 
When we look back at these Puritan societies in Salem, we can take the lesson of moral blindness which branches out to intransigent power, abusing fear to maintain power, and the patriarchy and imbalance of power. Moral blindness is still a major issue in our society today as we live in a country with many discrepancies when it comes to different ideologies, religions, cultures, and people. We believe that we are enlightened and better than these Puritan societies because we don't live in a society based on a dogmatic faith or a theocracy. Are we really better than the Puritans if we still use fear and propaganda to demonize groups that are different from us? America still faces issues of discrimination, racism, and prejudices of all sorts. During 2021 and the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a recent surge of anti-Asian sentiment. Disinformation and ignorance has created a greater divide between people, and has encouraged and influenced acts of violence towards Asians. Our previous president referred to Covid-19 as the China virus and Wuhan virus, creating the narrative that all Asian people were carrying the virus. Virulent statements filled with fear and prejudice from the President instilled fear within communities which contributed to the spike of racism and hate-crimes towards Asians. Some of the people who commit these crimes do it out of fear or hatred, blinded by a message from a racist president and the media. Moving forward, we need to show tolerance, and compassion to those whom we may not agree with so we can obviate the tragedy of the Salem witch trials or the public shame in The Scarlet Letter. We should be weary of being certain of our own rightness, other dogmas, and religious fanaticism which all contribute to our moral blindness. Works Cited

Moral Transgressions and Punishment: An Analysis/Explication of The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter
	Trevor Noah once said, society is a contract. Its a contract that we sign as human beings amongst each other (Noah 8:40-8:44). This contract refers to a set of rules that reflect the common morals and beliefs of a society. These ruleswhether implicit or explicitdescribe what actions members of society can and cannot do. When an individual violates this set of rules by doing something that society perceives as wrong, this individual also violates societys morals (a moral transgression). When an individual commits a moral transgression, they are often punished. Many punishments, such as imprisonment, involve society socially isolating individuals. However, social isolation can have negative effects on an individual, which may also impact other people. In Arthur Millers play The Crucible, negative effects can be seen in many characters. In particular, isolation affects Abigail Williams, the 17-year-old orphan who has an affair with John Proctor, and Thomas Putnam, a main accuser of witchcraft. As a result, they (Abigail and Thomas) commit moral transgressions. In Nathaniel Hawthornes book The Scarlet Letter, social exclusion affects several characters such as Roger Chillingworth who tortures Arthur Dimmesdale, a potent and lauded religious figure. This torturing is regarded as a transgression. The characters stated above reveal an important pattern about society: social isolation causes individuals to commit moral transgressions.  Because of this, moral transgressions shouldnt be addressedin current societiesthrough forced social isolation.
In the society of The Crucible, one individualBetty Parrislies in her bed not moving at the beginning of the play. There is a rumor of witchcraft and Reverend Parris wants to know if Betty (his daughter) is a victim of witchcraft. Parris interrogates Abigail to determine whether the girls committed witchcraft. However, he is not convinced that Abigail is telling the truth about the situation, and Parris thinks that she is compromising his reputation. He then begins to question Abigails reputation and says, And yet it has troubled me that you are now seven month out of their house, and in all this time no other family has ever called for your service (Miller 11). Here, Parris describes Abigails role in society. Her only purpose is to provide service to families for short periods of time. Even then, no other family wants Abigail. Abigail later says, they want slaves, not such as I (Miller 11). She (Abigail) is seen as a slave who is inferior to everyone else. This shows that society alienates Abigail. The effect of this social exclusion can be seen when Abigail begs John Proctor to resume their past relationship. Abigail says, I never knew what pretense Salem was, I never knew the lying lessons I was taught by all these Christian women and their covenanted men! And now you bid me tear the light out of my eyes? I will not, I cannot (Miller 22). Abigail claims that Salem has pretense and everyone is lying. She claims that Proctor put light in her eyeswhich is a symbol of understanding and intelligenceas opposed to the darkness which society previously put in her. This darkness refers to her experience of isolation and exclusion. Abigail also mentions that she was taught lying lessons. Here, she alludes to herself deceiving the village to seek revenge for the darkness that the village put in her. Later, Abigail does deceive the village (by accusing and killing innocent people) because she is bereft of inclusion. When the issue is brought to court, Francis says to judge Danforth, [the girls] are all deceiving you. Then Danforth is shocked (Miller 80). Since the girls, who are led by Abigail, are truthfully accused of deceiving judge Danforth in court, Abigail has stepped over society's legal line. Also, Danforth is shocked, which shows the severity of Abigail's transgression. So, by making her inferior, society isolates Abigail which causes Abigails hate for society. Ultimately, this hate causes Abigail to become a transgressor. What this chain of events reveals is the importance of maintaining a strong connection with ones family. Abigail has a dearth of familiar connections, which leads her to commit many lamentable actions and cause chaos. If Abigail had had a strong, familiar connection with someone, the violent and selfish transgressions that she commits would likely not have occurred. So, the play (The Crucible) reveals the importance of maintaining a familiar relationship.
Also, at the beginning of the play, after Parris interrogates Abigail about her relationship with witchcraft, Mr. Putnam enters the scene to help determine if witchcraft is occuring. He (Putnam) immediately jumps to the conclusion that witchcraft is certainly happening and is having an important effect on the village. Then, we are given a backstory about Putnams life. When he previously ran for office, he undoubtedly felt it poor payment when he wasnt elected. This is because he regards himself as the intellectual superior of the village (Miller 13-14). His sense of superiority reveals that Thomas Putnam mentally separates himself from the rest of the village by thinking that he is the only smart person. This separation from others leads Putnam to feel that his own name and the honor of his family [has] been smirched by the village, and he mean[s] to right matters however he [can]. Here, he feels hatred for the rest of the village and wants to seek revenge however he [can]. This vindictive, belligerent, and non-amicable nature that he develops is why it is not surprising to find that so many accusations against people are in the handwriting of Thomas Putnam. Putnam also encourages his daughter to falsely accuse people at the most opportune junctures of the trials in order for him to kill people and gain their land (Miller 14). This transgression and Putnams lack of integrity are caused by the isolation that he creates. What this reveals is the importance of understanding others, both emotionally and ideologically. If Putnam understood and felt sympathy for more peopleinstead of isolating/distancing himself by thinking he is superiorhe likely would not have killed or tried to kill anyone.
In The Scarlet Letter, when Chillingworth returns to the village after being physically distant, he sees Hester being pilloried. He (Chillingworth) seeks to develop an understanding of the situation and he asks a townsman to reveal the reason why Hester is being pilloried. Chillingworth says, I am a stranger, and have been a wanderer, sorely against my will. I have met with grievous mishaps by sea and land, and have been long held in bonds among the heathen-folk, to the southward; and am now brought hither by this Indian, to be redeemed out of my captivity (Hawthorne 57). Chillingworth is a stranger to the village and does not know anyone besides Hester. While he was a wanderer, he was always a heathen. When he is finally set free in the village, Chillingworth seeks to integrate himself by finding the person who he thinks will care for him and love him: Hester Prynne. However, when Chillingworth sees that Hester, his wife, had a baby and committed adultery, his look [becomes] keen and penetrative. A writhing horror [twists] itself across his features (Hawthorne 56). He realizes that Hester doesnt actually love or care for him and that he will remain socially isolated without Hester. This realization affects Chillingworth by making his thoughtswhich are metaphorically referred to as his facial featureskeen, penetrative, and twisted with a writhing horror. This quote foreshadows the cathexis that Chillingworth later develops for Arthur Dimmesdale where he (Chillingworth) becomes extremely mentally involved and obsessed with Dimmesdale. Chillingworth [digs] into the poor clergymans [Dimmesdales] heart, like a miner searching for gold (Hawthorne 113). In foreshadowing this cathexis, the quote subtly relates Chillingworths social isolation with the cathexis which suggests a correlation between isolation and the cathexis. This evil cathexis that Chillingworth developsas a result of his isolationis soon noticed by the rest of the town. As the text says, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personages of especial sanctity, in all ages of the Christian world, was haunted either by Satan himself, or Satans emissary, in the guise of old Roger Chillingworth [...] The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see the minister come forth out of the conflict, transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win (Hawthorne 112). The townspeople think Dimmesdale is a person of especial sanctity. They (the townspeople) know that Dimmesdale is haunted in the guise of old Roger Chillingworth. The peoples hope is unshaken that Dimmesdale would finish the conflict transfigured with the glory that he would unquestionably win. This widely diffused, complete confidence towards Dimmesdale, reveals the peoples attitude towards Chillingworth and his actions. The townspeople all agree that Dimmesdale is in the right while Chillingworth is in the wrong. This shows that Chillingworth has committed moral transgressions that stem from his cathexis for Dimmesdale and ultimately Chillingworths isolation. This chain of events reveals the importance of not having many expectations. Chillingworths downward spiral is partly caused by his expectation that Hester would love him when he returns to the town. However, when Hester doesnt love him, Chillingworth is completely devastated and the situation gets progressively worse. If Chillingworth did not have this expectation, he wouldnt have gone down the same, evil path.
No matter the situation or an individual's evilness, however, one thing that is common in human beings is judgment. In fact, it is natural to judge others (Forsythe, Francesca). However, when one judges someone elsein a negative wayone often avoids and distances themselves from that person. While this may seem negligible, small actions can augment someones negative thoughts. Individuals who are victims of isolation can develop a negative mental state which reflects all of the actions that have harmed them. The individual might then seek to alleviate their pain by, for example, inflicting their pain onto others. In The Scarlet Letter, Pearl [is] a born outcast of the infantile world and the town completely isolates her. Pearl seeks to relieve the painwhich was caused by the isolationin many ways. For example, If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did, Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them (84). The isolation and suffering that was inflicted onto Pearl by the town cause Pearl to grow positively terrible. Pearl inflicts her pain onto the children and because of this, the children [have] a vague idea of something outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions in the mother and the child; and therefore [scorn] them in their hearts (84). Here, we can discern the beginning of a long chain of infliction caused by the isolation and judgment of Pearl. In real life, one small act of judgment can also help cause a long chain of infliction. For example, at lunchtime in school, if someone is eating alone at a table, one might judge this person and think that they have no friends and therefore are a weird person. This judgment could lead one to cause isolation from that person and prevent future interactions. Sensing this exclusion, the person that was alone might begin to build up negative emotions inside themselves. Eventually, to get rid of these emotions, the person might get angry at others, interrupt in class, or disobey which would spread negative emotions, and ultimately a chain of infliction would occur. So, next time we sense ourselves judging someone else, we must realize the isolation that we are causing and its potential effects on others.Works Cited

The Intersection Between Perceived Moral Transgressions and Selfishness
Many people struggle with selfish impulses. Not keeping the best piece of cake for yourself, or giving up your spot in line for someone else to take your place, is a hard thing to do. These selfish impulses come from humans' deep-rooted survival instincts. When safe spaces and food were not as available as they are today for many people, the person who focused on securing resources for themselves and put their own needs above others was the most likely to survive. And although many people no longer have to fight to obtain enough resources to survive, our instincts connected to survival still motivate many to selfishly act. The writers Nathaniel Hawthorne and Arthur Miller both explore this concept of selfishness in their respective works, The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible. Both of the pieces specifically investigate how selfishness affects a person's sense of morality. The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible are both set in the town of Salem, which was part of the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Scarlet Letter is set in the middle of the 17th century, whereas The Crucible is set around 40 years later at the end of the century. The Scarlet Letter follows Hester Pryne, a woman who committed adultery, during the seven years after she is sentenced by the town's religious figures to wear a scarlet letter A on her clothes, and become a pariah. The Crucibles main character is also someone who has committed adultery. But, in the play, the main character, John Proctor, does not get found out as an adulterer until the end. Proctor becomes involved in the town witch hunt that was based on the real Salem Witch Trials that took place in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 and 1693. In the play, a group of teenage girls, led by a girl named Abigail, goes to court and accuses many of the townspeople of being witches. Many people are hanged because of accusations that have no real evidence supporting them. The Crucible both demonstrates the chaos and virulence of the witch trials and tells a tale of townspeople who have abandoned their morals in the face of an opportunity for self-gain. The Scarlet Letter also has a similar secondary meaning. The book displays the evolution of the townspeople's view of Hester, a sinner, and a social outcast. And also shows how Reverend Dimmesdale goes against his religious moral obligations as a minister to protect his job and social rank by withholding the information that he was the person that committed adultery with Hester. Both of these pieces of literature express that selfishness and self-preserving behaviors can cause individuals to deviate from their societies moral code, and possibly commit a transgression against that code. 
Characters in The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible are willing to commit acts that disobey their societies moral codes to protect themselves and put their reputations above the lives of many others. Both John Proctor and Reverend Dimmesdale withhold crucial information from their entire towns because they do not want the townspeople to know that they have committed adultery. In John Proctor's case, he doesn't tell the town that the accusations of witchcraft are fake and that the girls are lying about being tormented by witches. He conceals this information because Abigail, the leader of the group of girls, is the one who told him. Abigail is the person that has committed adultery with him, and he fears that if he tells the town that she told him, he will have to explain the nature of their relationship. Because Proctor is married, a close relationship with a seventeen-year-old girl who had been his household worker would have seemed suspicious to the town and been scrutinized during the court proceedings. Proctor is apprehensive that his act of adultery will be discovered, destroying his social status and alienating him from the town. So when he is given a chance to reveal the information about the accusations, it is not his moral compass that drives him to tell, but his wife Elizabeth's prompting. Reverend Hale, one of the town's religious figures, comes to their house because Elizabeth has been accused of being a witch. And during a discussion about the accusations, Elizabeth says to Proctor,
ELIZABETH, with a note of desperation: I think you must tell him, John.
HALE: Whats that?
ELIZABETH, restraining a call: Will you tell him?
Slight pause. Hale looks questioningly at John.
PROCTOR, with difficulty: I -- I have no witness and cannot prove it, except my word be taken. But I know the childrens sickness has naught to do with witchcraft.                    
(64)
Proctor is reluctant to share what he has come to learn from Abigail, and shares only when forced to by his wife. Many townspeople are taken into court to be questioned while being threatened with hanging and have their reputations ruined because of the girl's accusations. But Proctor is still reticent to speak out against the injustices because of the fear of his reputation being expunged. He puts his social status above the lives of innocent people and their families. And although he ends up sharing Abigail's secret, it only after his wife was accused of being a witch and after being put on the spot by Elizabeth, that he confesses with difficulty. 
Reverend Dimmesdale from The Scarlet Letter also withholds crucial information from his town to protect his reputation. He withholds the information that he was the one who committed adultery with Hester. Near the beginning of the book, when Hester is sentenced for her acts of adultery that are perceived as a sin by her town, Dimmesdale himself calls for the person who committed the act with her to come forward. At the time Dimmesdale doesnt speak out, and after that day he continues to keep his involvement with Hester a secret. He is plagued by guilt, but he never breaks his silence on the issue for seven years. At the end of his seven years of hiding, Dimmesdale talks to Hester about his experience as a person who has sinned unbeknownst to the townspeople and churchgoers he interacts with. He says to her, Thou little knowest what a relief it is, after the torment of a seven years' cheat, to look into an eye that recognized me for what I am! (167) Dimmesdale is followed by the guilt of his actions throughout the seven years that he kept his act of adultery a secret, but he still kept his silence. He knows that if he confesses he will become a disgrace in the eyes of the town, lose all the town's esteem, and get shunned for hiding his sin. Because of his fear, he lies to the townspeople, and as an important religious figure in the town, he goes against all he stands for. Although the information Dimmedsdale withheld would have not obviated unjust deaths like information John Proctor concealed, he still lets his true nature be covered by the guise of purity and God's mouthpiece. Both Reverend Dimmesdale and John Proctor act on their selfish natures by not bringing forward important information and prioritizing their reputations over many people's lives and trust.
During the beginning of The Crucible, the reader watches the first witch accusation of the town. The person who first accuses someone of being a witch is Abigail, who eventually is the leader of the group of girls accusing people of witchcraft. The person she accuses is Tituba, a slave in her household. Before Tituba is accused, Abigail is being questioned by some of the town's leaders about acts involving witchcraft her friends and she are rumored to have done. Her reputation is in jeopardy and some of the religious leaders are present, so when Tituba walks into the room Abigail uses her as a scapegoat for her actions: Mrs. Putnam enters with Tituba, and instantly Abigail points at Tituba. ABIGAIL: She made me do it! She made Betty do it! (40). This is an example of Abigail's self-preserving behavior. Immediately after Tituba walks into the room, Abigail places all the blame for her reprehensible behavior on Tituba. Abigail is being interrogated before Tituba enters the room, and she never once mentions being controlled by a witch or mentions Tituba's name. Tituba's arrival is convenient for Abigail, and in the spur of the moment, Abigail makes Tituba her scapegoat to save herself. Because of Abigail's accusation against Tituba, Tituba goes to court and at the end of the book is hanged because she is convicted of being a witch. The accusation surrounding Tituba leads to other townspeople's deaths as well. Tituba, like the others who were accused of being witches, is offered a deal where if she confesses to taking part in witchcraft and indicts other townspeople of the same crime, she can prevent her demise. Tituba is coerced by the town's religious leaders to confess, and eventually accuses others of being witches. This creates a domino effect because many of the people Tituba implicates take the same deal Tituba was offered and indict even more people. Mary Warren speaks on this deal, saying: But Mr. Proctor, they will not hang them if they confess(56). The court of Salem adopted the same system that caused Tituba to confess and condemn others early in the play before the accusations had run rampant. Like Abigail, the people who chose to take the deal sacrificed others to save themselves. The actions of Abigail and other accused townspeople were motivated by selfishness. And selfishness caused many of the accused people to lie and condemn others to the same fate. 
John Proctor and the townspeople from The Crucible and Dimmesdale from The Scarlet Letter all act in ways that violate the moral codes that the other people in their community generally stick to. The actions of these characters point to the notion that a person's morality is often abandoned when their life, reputation, or livelihood is threatened. This means that when a person acts in a way that deviates from the social code they generally follow, there might be an underlying threat to themselves that is the impetus behind their behavior. When someone commits a perceived moral transgression, there is a motivation behind that action. And when being judged for their moral transgression if their motivation is explained, it may affect how harsh the judgments they face will be.  If someone deviates from the moral code but has altruistic motivations and intentions, their actions may be judged less harshly. But since we know that selfishness can motivate perceived moral transgressions, a selfish motivation may also be the cause. If someone committed a perceived moral transgression and the people judging their action knew that they were motivated to act because of selfishness, their judgments may be affected by the deviants motivation. Selfish motivations will impact how a perceived moral transgression is judged.

The United States voting system uses primary elections to eliminate candidates before the final election for president. This system uses, essentially, plurality voting with a form of run-off voting. This allows for citizens to get a fuller understanding of all the candidates and their beliefs/opinions before the Presidential election starts, as well as slowly eliminating all candidates until the final presidential elect is chosen. During the final election, the candidate who gets the majority of electoral college votes (not necessarily the popular vote of the citizens) wins the election. 
Now, though this may seem like a fair way to conduct elections, lets first take a look at third-party candidates. Now, the name third party is a bit deceiving, as any party thats not the democratic or republican party is labeled as so. This is because these two parties (democratic and republican) are seen as dominating parties, and, through years of these parties being predominant in the elections, many people now see voting for a third party as throwing away a vote, because a third party will never win, and now a democratic or republican candidate you like is not getting your vote. And, because of how the voting system works in America, these third party candidates get little to no accurate representation, and the cycle is perpetuated. 
In the article we read; Why Vote Third-Party? It talks about how our elections are basically staged, and how the goal of both democratic and republican parties is to incite fear in the citizens to get them to vote for whichever they fear less. The article also argues that the parties are, at their core, the same, and nothing much improves in the country depending on which party wins. Im not sure if I agree with all the points that this article makes, but I do think it would be interesting to see how the country would change if someone of a third party was to be elected. I also agree with the point that people from third parties are unrepresented, as I personally havent heard a lot about any third party. Perhaps a way this could be changed is by using a more proportionally representative system like a form of instant run-off voting with preference ballots, so if a person gets a certain percent of the vote they are elected. However, this goes against our system of government as we vote for one president, or congress(wo)man state by state, and not just a bunch of people from the country. However, if we somehow did use some sort of proportional representation, so that even when someone wins a majority other voices are still heard, this would help to secure more representation for people of third parties. This, in turn, will spread more information and get more people interested in third parties, and the cycle would be broken. I dont know how well people would respond to this, but many people dislike straying from what theyve always known, especially if it involves a change in the formation of our government. 
In conclusion, our governments system of voting is rather flawed in the fact that its been dominated for a long time by two status quo parties, and the under-representation of third party candidates only preserves the cycle in which they are ignored. If our voting system were to, perhaps, use a form of instant run-off voting this might help to achieve more proportional representation, and would solve the problem of the two-party domination in this country.

The use of a taylor series is to approximate something that isn't exact, for instance, E=mc^2 isnt 100% accurate in describing the amount of energy that any given amount of matter equates to. In order for a slightly more accurate approximation to be made, we can use a taylor series to increase the accuracy of the formula as can be seen below:
So how can we use python to create a series?
Python is regarded as an easier language to understand because its more user friendly and requires less knowledge of the syntax in order to code with it. But I will be explaining a few things about the language on the way just to make it more understandable. I'll show how we can code not only a taylor series but also a maclaurin series (where x=0) and even where x= any value. However, for these examples Ill just be using e^x to make things as simple as possible.
e^x coded:
We can already know what a taylor series for e^x looks like:
But actually approximating all of that and using a calculator where you press the buttons physically is boring. So this is why we can just write a bit of python to do it for us!
The main idea of using code to calculate a taylor series is so that we can instantly calculate any term from the series with any value on command.
Step one:
First of all, in order to make a taylor series we will have to use factorial and in order to code that into Python we need to import the module from its library
Step two:
Now we need to define the function. The code below defines that there is an x variable and an
n. The reason that we set our e approximation to equal 0 here is so that later it doesn't mess up the calculations, don't worry it's fine probably.
Step Three:
The next step is to make it so that we can calculate any value n with any value x. In order to do this we will have to use something called for loop in python. What the code on line 7 means is that we repeat the line below it n number of times.
(The x and n input things are just so that you can input the values for x and n, I forgot to add them at the beginning)
Step four:
Bellow is a table of values in the taylor series of e^x and how they would look coded into python:
This is why earlier we set e_approx = 0 because when you use the += operation, it would add
e_approx onto the x**i/math.factorial(i) and end up changing the value.
Finally, we return the definition of the function func_e and set the out variable to func_e and then print the final result.
The code in action:

Conclusion: The code that I wrote specifically isn't necessarily the most useful but it does prove that we can then write code for potentially more complex equations and approximations using the taylor series that we otherwise wouldnt be able to solve outright and the fact that its possible to can be a great help to mathematicians.
Thanks for reading!

Every human has unique markers of who they are, whether those be physical attributes or mental capabilities, making it difficult to group humans together. Our stark genetic individuality makes humans difficult to categorize by any physical or mental traits, so we must look to other markers of character. Communication is one of the most important things to human survival, so we place much importance on the ability of others to communicate with us. Every human communicates in a form of language, and because language is learned rather than inherited, conclusions drawn become more centered on the human rather than their genetic lineage. Language holds known qualities and has geographical, socioeconomic, and cultural markers, giving it the ability to communicate more concrete information about the speaker (signer/writer) than a more subjective trait like race. However, although we know of the irrationality of judging people based on subjective factors, we continue to avidly use race to identify people. Despite our use of race though, language defines a human more than the color of their skin because language is an objective skill and trait whereas race is subjective. 
Race is an arbitrary trait, so it is less useful to identify people than language is, but when humans do not have language as an identifier, we tend to cling to race. In his book, Born a Crime, Noah tells a story of him and his friend shoplifting chocolates, getting caught, and running away. Noahs friend Teddy was unable to escape, but Noah was, so the next day at school, Noah was brought to the principal's office and questioned about Teddys shoplifting accomplice. The event was recorded and Noah was caught on camera next to Teddy, but his color was washed out in the footage. The school staff grilled [him] for a good ten minutes, but only because they were so sure that [he] had to know who [the] white kid, on camera with Teddy, was (159). The staff was so fixated on the perceived race of the accomplice that they failed to notice that he and Noah had the same face. Noah was not caught for shoplifting with Teddy because the teachers and police were unable to value objective features such as his facial shape, nose, hair, etc. over the subjective marker of race. 
One can however, observe that, though race is valued above other physical traits, language is valued above race. When Noah was young, he and his mother went to a shop and the owner told the security guard in Afrikaans, assuming they would not understand, to follow them because they were black and would therefore steal. Noahs mother then responded to him in Afrikaans, informing him that the owner and guard should be helping them shop instead of watching them. The owner immediately apologized, saying, Oh, Im so sorry, [...] I thought you were like the other blacks, showing that he had regrouped Noah and his mother the moment he heard their language (55). While they were still black, because they knew the language of the owner, they became more akin to him than to other black people, leading him to strike his assumption that they would steal. Later in the same chapter, Noah details how he was able to avoid being mugged by Zulu men by speaking to them in their language. When approaching him from behind, they said, Lets get this white guy, but after Noah responded to them in Zulu, they apologized for targeting him and said, We were trying to steal from white people (56). They found him to be white because of his lighter skin tone, but once they found out that he spoke Zulu, they recategorized him to be nonwhite, demonstrating the importance of language trumping that of arbitrary race when grouping people. 
The importance of language over race is clear in Noahs book, but one must consider the possibility that language only trumps race when a common language is not expected. In South Africa there are eleven official languages, so it is not expected that everyone knows the same language (161). In America, it seems, common language is taken for granted because it is expected, yet one can still observe the phenomenon of language over race in America where there is the expectation. People continue to categorize humans by race, but whereas in South Africa a common language increases ones status, in America a lack of common language decreases your status. A small distinction, but both reactions to a common language or lack thereof, demonstrate the importance of language when grouping people. It is certain, however, that language is valued over race in South Africa.?Road Curvature
Definition of Curvature: The definition of curvature is the rate of change in heading over a period of distance.
How Curvature can be Calculated from Data: The x and y values are coordinate points, so, longitude and latitude values from the map. S is the distance traveled between points while theta is the angle that is changing between points. Because we have x and y, we have the sides of the triangle that can be drawn with the hypotenuse being the distance between two points.
Delta s is the hypotenuse (distance between the points) while delta x and delta y are the other two sides. Theta is the angle between delta x and delta s. To find theta, we can use the inverse tangent of delta x and delta y and to find delta s, we can use the pythagorean theorem as we have the other two sides of the road. To find delta theta, first, we would have to do the same thing for the other points. Delta theta is the difference between two consecutive theta values.
Finally, we can find K, the turning rate, which is delta theta / delta s.

Choice of Road: Stelvio Pass
The actual distance from Point A to Point B (when you dont take the road) is only 0.5 miles. My approximation for the distance between Point A and Point B (when you do take the road) is about 3-ish miles.
Why I picked this: Honestly, I picked Stelvio Pass because I looked up the curviest roads in the world and Stelvio Pass was one of them. Stelvio Pass is located in the Alps, which Ive actually
been to, and when I was looking at pictures of it, I thought it was really pretty. Here is what it looks like in real life:
Summary of Average Curvature of Road: You can take the average of the curvature of the road (delta theta tangent / delta s). What I got was around 18253. The turning rate, or the radius of the circle that hugs the curve would be r = 1/K or r = 1/average. Thus, inputting my value for the average into this equation, I would get that the turning rate of Average K = 1/18253. This is in the unit of latitude degrees and when you convert it to meters, you get 6.09 m, which means the average of the road is pretty curvy.
How to Improve Calculation: One way to improve calculations is to smooth the data out. When looking at your road on Google Maps, it would seem very jagged when in reality, the curves are not that pointed. So, to smooth the data out, you would take the averages for both the x and y values of two values before and two values after (taking the average of 5). That smooths out the graph. You also have to remember to change delta x and delta y so that they use the smoothed out x and y values instead of the original values. You also have to remember to delete the last two values of the smoothed out x and y values and delete the last four values for the new delta x and delta y values (and consequently, the last four values for the rest of the columns after delta x and delta y).?Prompt Chosen: D. Noah asserts that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people(p. 56). Do you agree with Trevors assessment of the importance of language? What do his claims suggest about the power of language and the values placed on certain languages over others?
Sandor Jonas E300
Mari OMeara
In the life of Trevor Noah as recounted in his autobiographical novel, Born A Crime, his ability to fluently speak multiple native African languages like Xhosa, Tswana and Tsonga alongside English and Afrikaans, allow him to navigate situations in which his race would have otherwise proven as too much of a barrier to overcome. I agree with Trevors assessment of the importance of language, and I also agree that speaking the language commonly spoken by the upper class and to be able to talk like them too can provide incredible opportunities of mobility for someone born into a lower class that are otherwise extremely rare to find.
The ability to speak English, more than any other language, can allow for communication with those that wield economic power in most of the world. Throughout his book, Trevor brings up many times he can directly recall that knowing how to communicate effectively via language has saved him or his mother. For example, when the owner of a shoe store they are shopping in asks the guard to follow them in Afrikaans but Trevors mom is able to understand and respond in Afrikaans, bridging the gap between her and the shopkeeper which allows her to defuse the situation. This is a good example of the power that language has to form a connection between two people that otherwise would have never been possible due to the language barrier, but this doesnt directly show how language can create mobility in the lower class. In chapter 5: The Second Girl, Trevor Noah describes his mothers childhood as it has been told in stories to him by his mother. She grew up extremely poor, he mentions how she oftentimes had to steal food scraps from the pigs just to eat and at times had to eat clay mixed with water just in order to feel
full. Despite all of these hardships, his mother was able to raise him with far more opportunities than she had herself, he explains that in the following quote my mother was blessed that her village was one of the places where a mission school had contrived to stay open in spite of the government's bantu education policies. There she had a white pastor who taught her English. She didnt have food or shoes or even a pair of underwear, but she had english. She could read and write(65). With her ability to speak, read and write English, she was able to get a job at a sewing machine that allowed her to take a secretarial course and become a secretary, making more money than anyone else in her family. Her knowledge of English gave her the opportunity to get an education which then allowed to get a job that broke through the barrier of economic status she was born into. This shows how language can serve as an oppressive tool because all those who didnt speak English where she came from had little to no opportunities at all regardless of how hard they worked, but when one can break this barrier and become educated, it becomes possible to escape such oppression.
One of the main themes of the book is clashing of races and Trevor and his moms ability to navigate a system under an aparthied and post apartheid government as a black mother with a colored son. Language is a key tool used by Patricia and taught to Trevor that he highlights as one of the most powerful things that allowed them to lead the bold lives that they did. They were empowered by their knowledge of language in South Africa and this afforded them the ability to seek freedoms that most others in their situation would never have had.?Finding One of the Worlds Curviest Roads
Camilo Tamayo-Rousseau
The world has many curvy roads, but how can we find exactly how curvy they are? In this paper, we will figure out a method for calculating the curvature of a road and apply it to one of the curviest roads in the world. The calculations can be found in this Google Sheets: Road Curvature Calculus
Defining Curvature
	Straightness and curviness are opposites of each other; the curvier a road, the less straight it will be and vice versa. Circles are useful for defining straightness and curviness because, depending on how large they are, circles can be very straight or can be very curvy; small circles are more curvy than large circles because they bend more sharply. To help define the curvature at a point with circles, a circle with a fitting radius (which we talk about later) can be drawn at a point on the curve. Then the curvature can be found based on the radius of the circle.
	To figure out how to find the curvature based on the circles radius we first must think about the relationship between the curvature and the radius. As the radius of the circle increases, the curvature should approach zero but never reach zero. This is because as the circles radius approaches infinity, the circle appears as if it was a straight line. On the other hand, when the radius of a circle approaches zero, the curvature should approach infinity because the smaller a circle is, the more sharply the curve bends. Based on this relationship between curvature and radius, we can create a more precise definition of curvature () as a function of the radius ():  .Calculating Curvature
	To apply the curvature function to a road, we first must be able to find the radius of the circle that is tangent to the road. This road is defined by a series of points which we can use to calculate the properties of a circle. More specifically, we can use the change in distance (?s) and angle between two points (??) to calculate the circumference of the circle, angle at the center of the circle, and therefore the radius. 
Since , this means that . So, to find the curvature from a series of points (which represents a road), we can calculate  and . Finally, we can input those values into the function for .
Finding the Curvature of a Road
	To find a curvy road, I looked at mountainous areas of the world because roads with a significant change in elevation should be curvy as curvy roads are effective at changing the vertical elevation of a car. An examination of Mount Everest (the mountain with the highest elevation in the world) and its surrounding region helped me find many curvy roads. Specifically, I chose an unnamed road in Nepal about 54 miles south of Mount Everest. 	Using Google My Maps, I obtained a set of 3594 points that represent the road. Once I had these points, I found a value for  for each point.
Results
	The average curvature for the road was 4905 which means that on average, the turning radius was 22.7 meters. However, simply averaging the curvature of all the points is not a very accurate way of representing the overall curvature of the data set. This is because each point is not evely spaced on the road and some points help represent a larger portion of the road than others. To get a better average, we can weigh each point differently based on the distance between it and the following point (this distance is ). Then, an improved average can be calculated by taking the integral of  with respect to  and dividing this by the road length (sum of ): . The integral can be calculated using rectangleseach with dimensions and summing the total area of the rectangles.The road lengththe sum of all is 71 miles. After using this improved average, the average curvature becomes 1622 which means that the average turning radius is 69 meters. In comparison, the famously curvy Lombard Street has an average turning radius of 13.7 meters. However, this comparison is slightly unfair because Lombard Street is not a road that is meant for practical use and is only 0.11 miles long while this road is 67 miles long.
Calculation Accuracy and Error
	Theoretically, we should be able to reconstruct the road from the areas of the rectangles that we used to calculate . We can find the amount of error in our improved average calculations by finding how similar the reconstructed road is to the original road.
	The reconstructed road looks nothing like the original road. This is because the road was reconstructed using the curvature which is a scalar value and doesnt give any direction. To give the curvature a direction for the reconstruction of the road, we can simply remove the absolute value so that . Furthermore, the final step of the calculation of adding the sums of the integrals to the initial position was not correct for this road. This is because the order of the original points that represented the road did not (generaly) go from left to right but instead went from right to left. So instead of adding the integrals to the x0 and y0, the integrals should be subtracted from x0 and y0. After improving this reconstruction, the road looks more similar to the original road.However, the reconstructed road appears much flatter than the original which shows that there were some errors in calculating the improved average curvature/radius.
The way that we defined the road also introduced more error into the calculation; there were only 3594 points to represent a 67 mile road (length according to Google Maps). To find how accurate our representation of the road was, we can approximate the length of the road and compare that to the actual length. To approximate the length we can add up the distances between each point (); this results in a value of 71 miles. The percent error between this approximation and the actual length is 6.2% which contributed to some error in the calculations.?Historia
La regin de Castilla y Len est en el norte oeste de Espaa. La consiste en una meseta con un promedio de 760 metros, que se llama Meseta Central. Montaas rodean la meseta aparte de la frontera con Portugal, y el ro Duero biseca la regin este a oeste. La meseta es afortunada ya que la tierra es naturalmente frtil. Desafortunadamente, la poblacin de Castilla y Len haba disminuido recientemente, y la mayora de personas viven en ciudades ms grandes como Valladolid, Burgos, Len, y Salamanca. Castilla y Len es importante para la historia de Espaa porque forma Espaa moderna. 
El lugar que es Castilla y len moderna fue ocupado por varios poblaciones celtico como astures y celtibrico. Es probable que la presencia de celtas en Iberia data del siglo IX A. C. pero no sabemos con certeza. Los romanos llegaron a la regin durante la segunda guerra pnica en el siglo II A.C. y adjuntaron la regin despus de dos siglos de enfrentamiento con tribus ibricas y cltica, y colonias de griegos, cartagins, y fenicios. Durante el periodo de los romanos, la regin de Castilla y Len con la mitad oriental de la Pennsula Ibrica fue la provincia de Tarraconensis en el Imperio romano. Hasta la fecha, el impacto de los romanos en la regin vimos en la arquitectura como los acueductos de Segovia Va de la Plata que conecta Mrida en el norte a Astorga. Despues de la cada del imperio romano, fue un periodo de ocupacin militar por los Visigodos que derrotaron a los romanos en la batalla de Adrianpolis en 378. En 474, fue el comienzo de la invasin musulmana y los se quedaron en el centro y sur de Espaa. Durante el siglo VII fue el proceso de reconquista cuando los rabes y cristianos lucharon por el control de Espaa, hasta el siglo XIII. Expediciones al nuevo mundo en siglo XV de Cristbal Coln, Juan Ponce de Leon y Hernando de Soto comienzan de Castilla y Len, donde vivi la familia real. 
El Pacto de Tortosa (1869) fue un proyecto de organizacin creado despus de la muerte de la Reina Isabella II para redefinir la regin de Castilla y el nuevo rgimen. Este es el comienzo de la regin de Castilla y Len moderna. Este pacto parti la regin en dos provincias; Castilla la Vieja incluy Avila, Burgos, Len, Segovia, Valladolid y ms, lo que es ahora Castilla y Len.  La otra parte fue Castilla la Nueva, con Madrid, Toledo, Guadalajara y ms, que se llama Castilla La Mancha hoy. Con la Guerra Civil en los 1930, Espaa parti en los que apoyaron  la monarqua catlica o Espaa. Esta guerra adems de Espaa franquista condujo a Castilla y Len pidiendo autonoma de Estado Espaol.
Arquitectura
Segovia muestra la historia complicada de Castilla y Len por su diseo urbano y arquitectura. La organizacin de los barrios, calles, y casas en Segovia est basada en la estructura social de diferentes comunidades en varios tiempos. Por ejemplo, los moros, christianos y judios coexisten por muchos aos y tenan que trabajar juntos durante la revolucin industrial para sobrevivir. Podemos ver evidencia de estas culturas en los monumentos como el acueducto romano, Alczar del siglo XI, y catedrales gticas del siglo XVI. 
El acueducto en Segovia fue construido por los romanos y es uno de los acueductos ms conservados en el mundo. Durante el siglo I AC, los romanos usaban el Ro Fro para suministrar agua a muchos pueblos como Segovia. Su estructura es aproximadamente 30 metros en altura y extenda 14 kilmetros de valles y colinas al fuente de agua. El material de acueducto es el granito, que fue usado para pilares, arcos y paredes. A pesar de la edad del acueducto, la estructura se ha mantenido estable debido a su profundo fundamento. Pero, el acueducto no es solamente un recordatorio del pasado porque el acueducto fue usado hasta el siglo XIX y provey trabajo para muchos residentes. Ahora, es una caracterstica de Segovia que atrae turistas de todo el mundo.  
Alczar ahora es una fortaleza medieval de piedra en la parte antigua de la ciudad. Actualmente, el origen del castillo es debatido, pero sabemos que fue construido durante muchos siglos y por varias culturas. Segn muchos historiadores, el primer edificio fue construido por la dinasta de bereber almorvide, pero poco del edificio original fue conservado. Las primeras referencias al castillo fueron de 1120 A.D., 32 aos despus de que la ciudad fuera conquistada por cristianos durante la reconquista. Podemos concluir que durante la era de musulmanes la estructura fue solamente una fortaleza de madera construida encima de cimientos romanos. En el siglo 13, Alczar fue el lugar favorito de la familia real y el Rey Juan II contribuy a la fortaleza con una torre gtica. Fueron muchas renovaciones del castillo durante el Rey Felipe II en 1587 y 1839 despus de un incendio. Por eso, Alczar es una fusin de muchos estilos como romnico, gtico (de la Edad Media), y herreriano (hecho durante Felipe II) en el exterior. Tambin el interior es decorado en estilo mudjar por pintores rabes en periodo medieval. 
La catedral de Segovia es una catedral gtica con rasgos renacentistas en el centro de la ciudad en Plaza Mayor. El comienzo de construccin fue en 1525 en un estilo gtico tardo, y es una de las catedrales gticas ms tardas de Europa. La catedral anterior fue adyacente a Alczar, y usada por el ejrcito real para defender el castillo. En la Guerra de Comunidades de Castilla, ciudadanos de Castilla se levantaron contra Carlos I en 1520 y asediaron la catedral. En un par de meses, la catedral se arruin. Por estos hechos, el nuevo catedral fue reubicado lejos de Alczar, y construido usando el diseo de Juan Gil de Hontanon, un albail. Un rasgo de la catedral son las bvedas gticas, 33 metros de altura. El retablo mayor fue tallado por Francisco Sabattini y dedicado a la Virgen de la Paz que vimos en las vtreas tambin.

Human dreams range from the mundane to the fantastical to the bizarre. People throughout time have wondered where dreams come from, why they happen, if they mean anything, and what they mean. Some people claim that symbols in dreams have very specific meanings and that by analyzing dreams, we can better understand ourselves and what we need to do. Modern scientists are split on the issues. Some believe that dreams happen to help us with anxiety. Others think that we dream to prune memories. One popular theory states that dreams are caused by our brain trying to create something cohesive out of completely random inputs we get while sleeping. There are many critics of this theory. They argue that a random process could never create such complex and vivid dreams as we experience. They also state that because our brains have to physically stop us from acting out our dreams, the random theory would make dreams dangerous. Something this dangerous and worthless would most likely be cut out from the gene pool a long time ago. Furthermore, they think that because animals also dream, it is unlikely that dreaming is caused by random inputs. The author argues that the simplest solution is that even when sleeping, humans cannot silence their inner storyteller.

Religiousness as a Tool to Well-Being and Happiness in Different Countries
	Religion has been a fundamental binding agent in human civilization for centuries. In fact, the first prehistoric religions came into existence over fifty thousand years ago (Narr). Religion is still an important factor in human life today, with about eighty five percent of the world population being a part of a religious group (Religious Composition by Country). Given that religion is practiced by so many people, analysis of a variety of scholarly journal articles and data on religion and happiness can help illuminate the functional outcome of religion in society. Religions effect upon a society can be explored by observing its positive relation to happiness and well-being, in addition to examining the problems that arise when religion is restricted.
	Firstly, religion is a tool that aids in mental well-being. In Guatemala, there are many people living below the poverty line. In fact, Guatemala has the second-greatest level of poverty in the Americas (Dupraz-Dobias). To study this, Mara Ramrez-Luzuriag and others performed a study for BMC Psychology by analyzing, Vulnerable populations born in adverse environments that may restrict developmental potential (Ramrez-Luzuriaga et. al.). In their words, the study, Aimed to examine the cognitive and socioemotional correlates of psychological well-being and mental health in a cohort of Guatemalan adults born in contexts of poverty and malnutrition (Ramrez-Luzuriaga et al.). The researchers spoke with several hundred men and women, all of whom were in their forties and fifties and lived in, Four rural villages in eastern Guatemala and Guatemala City (Ramrez-Luzuriaga et al.). In addition to, Spirituality and religion, the team gathered data on, Psychological well-being, [...] emotional support, and executive function (Ramrez-Luzuriaga et al.). From their findings, despite the adverse conditions, high measurements of religion and spirituality correlated with high measurements of psychological well-being. As Ramrez-Luzuriaga and her fellow researchers noted, of all examined factors, spirituality and religion made the greatest contribution to psychological well-being. These findings support the notion that, in populations experiencing difficult circumstances, religion contributes to well-being and aid coping. (Ramrez-Luzuriaga et al.). So, despite the difficulties posed by poverty and malnutrition, strong connections to religion seem to aid in overall well-being and happiness.
Secondly, more understanding of religion and happiness can be gained from the numerous data sets that have been conducted on happiness and religiosity within countries around the world. Two partner research organizations, World Happiness Report and Gallup, have produced datasets on religiosity and happiness. In 2009, Gallup surveyed the question, Is religion important in your daily life? (Gallup WorldView). The top five countries who valued religion the most were Bangladesh, Niger, Oman, Somalia, and Sri Lanka. Each country had nearly one hundred percent of respondents say that religion was important to their daily lives (Gallup WorldView). In addition, the countries with the lowest importance of religion in their daily lives were: Sweden and Denmark. Both had more than eighty percent of respondents claim that religion is not important to their daily lives. Also, Norway and Estonia had almost eighty percent of negative responses. In contrast to the previous notion that high religiosity equates to happiness, the Scandinavian countries of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, were, in fact, in the top ten happiest countries in 2021 despite their position that religion is not important (World Happiness Report). To universalize the quantification of happiness, the World Happiness Report measures happiness on a scale called the Cantril ladder. The scale, Asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale (World Happiness Report). According to the happiness report, the least happy countries in 2021 were: Lesotho, Botswana, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, and Afghanistan. Afghanistan had the lowest score in the world, of about two point five. Lesotho was the highest of the group, with a score of slightly over three point five (World Happiness Report). Furthermore, Afghanistan, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe were all very religious countries according to the 2009 Gallup poll, with Afghanistan and Rwanda having about ninety-seven and ninety-five percent of people who claimed that religion was important to their daily lives respectively (Gallup WorldView). So, again, in contrast to the previous observations that showed high religiosity results in happiness, these countries are both very religious, yet, in comparison to the Scandinavian countries, very unhappy.
Furthermore, the most religious countriesof those that had data in the happiness reportof Niger, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, had happiness scores of about five, five, and four point three respectively (World Happiness Report). In terms of ranking, Niger and Bangladesh rank close to one hundredth out of one hundred and forty-nine countries in the survey (Gallup WorldView). So, even if religion is extremely important to the people of these countries daily lives, their happiness score does not reflect it. 
To summarize and evaluate these findings, while the happiest countries happen to be the least religious, they are also quite wealthy. The most religious countries, while being unhappy, are also very poor. And, it seems that the reason for the increased religiousness of these countries is to aid in well-being and happiness despite the impoverished conditions. As author for Gallup, Steve Crabtree writes about the Gallup religiosity dataset, Religion plays a more functional role in the world's poorest countries, helping many residents cope with a daily struggle to provide for themselves and their families (Crabtree). Concluding from these data, even though religion is not important in wealthy countries, it is an effective tool at providing happiness in poor countries.
	Next, the suppression of religious freedom, especially because of the enforcement of a single religion, is not beneficial for happiness nor well-being. A prime example of religious suppression in favor of a single, unifying religion, is the Kim regime of North Korea. North Korea is one of the few dictatorships in the world today. Author  Fransiskus Widjaja and others write about the development of the Juche ideology in North Korea for HTS Teologiese Studies journal. Widjaja summarizes the situation in the country as, North Korea is a communist country dictated by Kim Jong-Un of the Kim dynasty and known for its cruelty (Widjaja et. al.). Widjaja describes Juche ideology as, a tool the state has used to convince people of their government [...] The North Koreans were made to worship Kim with Juche, [meaning self-reliance,] as the political philosophy of a ruling government. However, it was transformed into religion because the people believed that the ruler (Kim Il Sung) [was] not elected; instead, he is a supreme human (Widjaja et. al.). So, Juche transformed from just the political system of dictatorship, to the religion of worshiping the dictator himself. Widjaja also makes comparisons about how Juche was developed and influenced by several different ideologies, such as Confucianism, Christianity, Nationalism, Chinese Communism, and Russian Communism. However, Juche has departed from the anti-religious doctrines of communism. Widjaja describes the transition in that, Juche has become a major religious force that has maneuvered North Korea to replace traditional Marxist communism (Widjaja et. al.). While North Korea is not communist, the country suppresses all religions other than Juche just as a communist nation would. Widjaja notes, When [the North Korean people] started honoring Kim as their god, no other religion was permitted (Widjaja et. al.). So, with the establishment of the Juche religion, religious freedom was suppressed.
As aforementioned, enforcing the single religion of Juche is the tool that allows the Kim Regime to maintain control and also the oppression of their people. A study by Jess Crespo Cuaresma and others uses proxy measurements, such as satellite light level readings in order to estimate poverty levels in North Korea. The study estimated a poverty rate of about sixty percent in 2018 (Crespo Cuaresma et al.). In addition, eighty thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand people are estimated to be in prison camps (North Korea: How Many Political Prisoners). While North Korea was not measured in the 2021 World Happiness Report, it can be asserted that, based upon the poverty rate and imprisoned population, a significant amount of North Korean residents are not happy. However, these residents are forced to remain in the unhappy situation due to the religious doctrine of dictator-worship, Juche, that is imposed upon them.
Furthermore, on the topic of the restriction of religion, there can be conflicts between legislation and religion. In this case, the region of North Kosovo, with a dual administrative system, has incompatible legislation on many protocols, including Covid-19 management. Author for the Journal of Comparative Politics, Anela orevic from Slovenia, writes about the situation of dual administrations, which are also called contested territories, 
In contested territories, fighting the pandemics, such as the one caused by COVID-19, is even more difficult, because people often receive contradicting instructions from each of the competing authorities. This leaves many people puzzled or even anxious, because they are not certain which measures they are supposed to respect (orevic).
The dual administrations of North Kosovo, the Republic of Serbia and the government of Kosovo, are divided not only politically, but also ethnically as well. These ethnic groups also have their own respective religious practices. The majority of the country of Kosovo, over ninety-five percent, are Sunni Muslims (Alexe). However, in the region of North Kosovo, the majority group are Orthodox Catholic Serbians (Mbogoni).
Initially, neither of the two administrations of North Kosovo imposed any restrictions on religious gatherings. orevic claims that this is because of two main issues, Kosovo is a post-conflict territory where the wounds of war are still fresh, which is why little is needed to spark tensions. This means that residual divisions still lie between ethnic groups and the restriction of religious practice could, according to orevic, further disrupt already bad interethnic relations, and thus greatly prevent an attempt to reach a certain political solution for this territory (orevic). Later, restrictions on religious gatherings were imposed (orevic).
So, as a result of the ban on religious practices, in addition to other conflicting legislation due to mixed signals from the dual administrations, the Serbian population in North Kosovo became upset with their government. orevic noted that, a survey conducted [by Marinkovic et. al.] in 2019 showed that 88.7 percent of the total number of surveyed people of Serbian ethnicity living in Kosovo point out that there is no political representative of the Serbian ethnic group in Kosovo that they trust (orevic). The fact that an extreme majority of Serbians in Kosovo mistrust their representatives indicates there are problems, both with the tumultuous nature of North Kosovos dual administration, but also with the restriction of freedoms, such as religion.
In conclusion, religion is observed to have a positive effect on societal well-being and happiness; in addition, the restriction of religion has the opposite effect. While religion does indeed have a positive relation to well-being, it is a tool most effectively used to augment happiness by the worlds poorest nations. Happy countries, on the other hand, do not need religious faith, in order to obtain happiness, because their basic needs are already met. However, as seen in the case of Guatemala, when people are bereft of their basic needs, they turn to religion in order to find happiness. When religion is restricted, however, especially in otherwise tumultuous circumstances such as the Kim regime or the pandemic-stricken region of North Kosovo, people are not able to benefit from the happiness provided by religion. So, because of its ability to maintain happiness in otherwise difficult circumstances, it is no wonder that religion has been with humans for the past fifty thousand years.Works Cited

The Cold War and the Korean War: Chinese, Soviet, and US Involvement
	The Korean War has long been a source of political controversy and intrigue. It affected various countries and is widely regarded by experts as having had significant influence on the beginnings of the Cold War. To understand the reasoning and beginning of the Cold War, the Korean War is a key event in history to highlight. When exploring the development of the Cold War in relation to the Korean War, it is necessary to analyze increasing tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and to identify the effects of Chinese influence that led to the Korean War.
For the United States, Korea was a pawn in the struggle against global Communism, especially in the East. After China had become a Communist state, Communist-fearing hysteria spread quickly throughout the United States in the 1950s. American leadership began to fear the effects of Communism on the rest of the world, and the supposed global chokehold it could potentially come to have. Their fear of the spread of Communism was essentially the only reason why the US chose to enter the Korean War, since
Truman and his advisors found themselves under increased domestic pressure not to appear "soft" on communism abroad. Thus, when North Korean troops invaded the South, the Truman administration seized upon the opportunity to defend a non-communist government from invasion by communist troops. Determined not to "lose" another country to communism, and interested in shoring up its anticommunist credentials, the Truman administration found itself defending a nation a world away from U.S. soil, 
and unknowingly setting the stage for the Cold War (US Enters the Korean). The United States projected their fears of global communism onto Korea, and took the chance to support their own capitalist values through proxy war. 
	The United States was not the only country involved in the Korean War to attempt to utilize Korea for their own political benefit. The Soviet Union needed to spread Communism throughout the East, and Korea was a valuable geopolitical asset. Russia had intended to take control of Korea since the 19th century, a relatively easy feat due to its close proximity to the country. The Soviet Union intended to assist North Korea in setting up their own Communist government, and selected Kim Il-Sung as leader, as they thought he would best support Communism in Asia. American fears about Communism spreading from the Soviet into the rest of the East turned out to be rooted in fact, and, From the beginning of the Cold War, America saw Soviet attempts to control Korea in regional and global terms (Campbell).  The main goal of the Soviet Union during the Korean War was to ensure that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or DPRK, would stay in power, as it would be a valuable political asset against the United States in the upcoming war, and in future political conflicts. The Soviet Union utilized the Korean War as a way to express their superiority over the rest of the world, and the superiority of communism as a whole. The division of the Koreas was a historical representation of the divide between capitalism and communism, orchestrated by both the United States and Soviet Union.
	The Korean War introduced an additional threat of a war between the US and China in the eyes of Chairman Mao. He feared that spillover from a US win of the Korean War would affect China, causing the United States to attempt to conquer Communism in the East all at once, and was afraid that the United States meant to proceed past the Korean border and make war on China. Although later relations would sour between Communist China and the Soviet Union, at that time Mao was still a close ally of the Soviets. He came under pressure from Stalin to react to the U.S. threat. In October 1950, China sent troops to help North Korea, and began their intervention in the Korean War. (The Korean War Begins) Maos fear that the Korean War would continue into China caused him to enter the war, effectively bringing about the countrys involvement regardless of the actions of the United States. This choice would go on to cause the Sino-Soviet split, and create significant challenges for the country during the Cold War. 
	While China entered the Korean War for self-preservation, it exited the war with a new Communist ally: North Korea. Having another neighboring country with similar values in the East was an excellent payoff for such a war. Chinese intervention was necessary to the outcome of the war, said outcome being a lack of reunification of the Koreas. This Chinese-North Korean allyship caused Mao to consider, the war to be a success and victory for the nation. In his opinion, the interference strengthened Chinas security and defense. The Korean War was officially celebrated by Mao and the CCP leadership as a great success and a victory over the threat of US imperialism, as well as the birth of a Communist neighbor. (Becker) While the United States entered the war as an attempt to combat the reach of global Communism, China entered the war for what was essentially the same reason, except with Capitalism. With the cementing of North Korea as an independent nation from South Korea, all countries involved felt as if they had lost out, only partially achieving their respective goals.
	Chinese and Soviet involvement with the Korean War strongly connects these countries with the Cold War, and sets the stage for the very existence of the Cold War in later years. The Korean War provided the United States with an opportunity to assert their superiority over the Communist regimes of the East, and for those Communist regimes to attempt to exercise authority over the Capitalist superpower that was the United States. The Korean War set the stage for increased aggression between the United States and Soviet Union, and brought China into the tension as well. While the Korean War simply began as an issue of reunification and proxy war, it set the stage for a decade-long global conflict that would come to affect millions of people.

Script
Terms and Origins
The war on science began as early as humans began practicing science. Science, defined in our case as the practice of the scientific method to gather information, is making sense of the world around us by means of observation and testing. Science says the right answer is the one that we can prove and reproduce.
One early example of a quarrel with science happened in Europe in the 1600s. Among the many peasants and farmers, we meet Isaac Newton1a, an English scientist. Newton, and surprisingly, completely separately but at the same time, the German scientist Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz1b, landed upon a revolutionary idea in mathematics: the infinitesimal. Up until this point in the history of mathematics, the system was concrete and all-encompassing. Any question that you could think of would have a concrete answer. However, with the concept of infinitesimals, this changed. Infinitesimals, and ultimately calculus, proved worrisome to the Catholic Church because they believed that God could not have created an abstract system. So, because it was flawed, it was wrong.
Because of this ideological clash between pure, holy, and concrete math, and unholy, chaotic, and abstract math of calculus--and, in fact, Newtons other theories like gravity too, the Church began a crusade on science. They banned the study and teaching of calculus in school, and threatened to imprison Newton. However, not all religious entities acted like the Cathloic Church.
Religions, especially the Abrahamic faiths, hold God as the ultimate ethos. Even if God determines the laws of the universe, that doesn't stop people from using science to discover them. It is important to note, supported by this idea, religion is not, by nature, anti-science. And, likewise, science is not anti-religion. The two can coexist.
While the European Dark Ages were unproductive for Europe, that same time period, between the years 500 to 1000 of the common era, the Islamic Empire was at its Golden Age. While math had yet to reach the level of complexity of calculus, an important new discovery, and abstraction, was made during this Golden Age: the discovery of the number zero. The work to understand importance of the number zero could not have been done without the network of knowledge and literacy provided by the religious foundation of Islam.
Ethos, Logos, Pathos
	One key element of the war on science is that oftentimes, the debate doesnt focus on the facts, or logos--from aristotelian argument structure, but rather about the influence and credibility of who is saying it, ethos. In religion, specifically with the Abrahamic faiths mentioned earlier, God is the ultimate ethos. Since, according to the Bible, God said that man was formed out of dust2, God formed man of the dust of the ground... (Genesis 2:7). Man didnt evolve from monkeys because it says otherwise in the Bible. In the war on science, the war is not about facts, it is on facts; ethos trumps logos.
The third aristotelian tool is pathos, or emotion. Pathos is used by modern internet tribes, which, like other tribes, groups members by a shared feeling; in certain cases, the feeling is that your government is lying to you. Internet tribals feel that they are being deceived and they know the real truth. These internet tribes have their homelands within platforms such as Facebook3a, Twitter3b, and Instagram3c, to name some--in fact, some tribes make their own platforms, i.e. Former President Donald Trumps new Truth3d network. Internet tribes need a common story in order to unite them.3eThese stories are quintessential examples of a challenge to ethos: conspiracy theories.
Conspiracy Theories
	Conspiracy theories are attractive for several reasons. First of all, they help humans make sense of events that they dont fully understand. Biologically, humans are tuned to seek patterns, to understand. If a pattern isnt clear, then we will invent one of our own. We find comfort in understanding, and thats where pathos is most powerful. We want to tell ourselves a story that confirms our beliefs. One theory example, from 9/114a, concerns what sounds better, that terrorists with no funding, who had little supplies, and lived in a cave, perpetrated one of the biggest terrorist attacks in the world, or 9/11 was a setup by the government. Conspiracy theorists have power over science because they dont have to rely on verifiable evidence, they forge their own facts.
Conspiracy theories also support the idea of war on, or at the very least aggression toward, those who disagree. Most often disagreement comes in the form of facts proven by science. Because conspiracy tribals can use whatever facts they wish, they can rely on shock factor statements for public engagement4b, in addition to attacking science-wielding disagreers. Examples of lies range in absurdity, but the takeaway is that conspiracy theorists make up their own facts to support their narratives.
Internet Tribals
The members of internet tribes are not just citizens who distrust the government, there are tribal members who are politicians too. One example is representative from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene4. Representative Greene holds many beliefs from internet tribes. Without hyperbole, she suggested that wildfires in California5 were not in fact caused by Global Warming, but rather that it was more plausible that jewish space lasers started the fires. Here is an example of a more absurd conspiratorial lie. It is already questionable when Politicians have absurd beliefs, but their beliefs can also cause harm. Representative Greene also does not conform with Covid Safety protocol because of conspiracy theories about vaccinations and mask-wearing. When internet tribals in positions of authority propagate such lies, it causes more harm than when tribals talk to the open internet.
Companies
Why do such prominent figures who are supposed to lead us have irrational beliefs? Aside from shock-factor leading to interaction and clicks on the internet, the answer is money. An easy way to see this is in how large companies disregard truth and science in favor of a narrative that helps them make money. The two examples of who really started the war on science in America are big oil, and big tobacco.
ExxonMobil
In terms of big oil, the prominent story comes from ExxonMobil. Around the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, ExxonMobil was concerned with their effect on the environment, so they did good research. And, as it turns out, the research showed that drilling for oil and burning fossil fuels was harmful to the environment. But, that, quite literally, wouldnt sell--it wouldnt make money. So, ExxonMobil changed their narrative. Exxon constructed studies from fake scientists that claimed that their actions were safe and didnt contribute to climate change. 11aExxonMobil granted $10,000 to the science and Environmental Policy Project founded by climate denial advocate, physicist, and environmental scientist Fred Singer. Before that, ExxonMobil also funded the work of solar physicist Wei-Hock Soon, who said that most global warming is caused by solar variation
Fake Scientists
Profit came before care. Fake scientists have been a very large part of the war on science. When trust in scientists is breached, people start to lose their faith. Once the trust in scientific practice was broken people started to question other narratives aside from just ExxonMobils claims--even truthful ones that used real scientists. Having fake scientists in the mix gives more room for conspiracy theorists to sow doubt. So, if we can't trust scientists, then who can we trust?
Big Tobacco
Another group of companies that disregarded the health of the world in order to make money was Big Tobacco. In addition to the aforementioned tactics of fake studies by fake scientists, Big Tobacco convinced not only its customers, but also its executives that certain false claims were true: that nicotine was, in fact, not addictive. However, this statement is profoundly untrue, and some people knew it at the time.6
Even if the CEOs of the tobacco companies truly believed that nicotine wasnt addictive, that wasnt the case with ExxonMobil. Quite recently, news has revealed the fact that ExxonMobil officials knew about their negative impact. But, again, they didnt seem to care. The story was, according to their CEO Darren Woods, Exxon Mobil has long recognized that climate change is real and poses serious risks, but there are no easy answers. Oil and gas will continue to be necessary for the foreseeable future. We currently do not have adequate alternative energy sources. This is one way of saying that Exxon didnt seem to mind that they were causing problems. Lenny Bernstein, a 30-year industry veteran and Exxons former in-house climate expert, wrote, Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2, or carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change. Once again, the lie was more profitable than the truth.
Corruption
To sum it all up, corruption is what happens when entities, be those politicians or companies, put money and or power above the welfare of people. Politicians knew that climate change was real but invested financially, and for the endurance of their own political employment, in a difference of belief. Politicians are meant to do whats best for the community, but when they have a desire for power over their desire for communal benefit, that is corruption.
The Hint of The Turn
Flashback to the war in Vietnam in the 60s. Around that time, lots of science in America was devoted to military technologies. This trend continued until the 1970s: science funding was massive, science was for war. In fact, the 1960 Time magazine person of the year was just all Scientists. However, in 1976, the American people experienced the first step in the turn in the credibility of science.
The Swine Flu was noticed first on the military base Fort Dix in New Jersey. It caused one death, and hospitalized 13 other people. Swine Flu never left the base. However, at the time, the United States government didnt know that. They had two options, force vaccination, or hope for the best. They prepared for the worst. David Sencer, head of the CDC at the time, said that it was, unacceptable to plan for less than 100% coverage [of vaccination]. The government was scared of the swine flu, and so, in turn, the people were too. The government launched an aggressively-advertised national vaccine campaign. The American public has always been suspicious of national vaccine campaigns, but this campaign didnt help that cause. As is reasonable, the government assured everyone that the vaccines were safe. However, out of the millions that took the Swine Flu vaccine, sixteen people got serious side-effects. It appeared as if the government was lying about the risks, which spurred fear and skepticism about the science surrounding the vaccines.
Media Narrative
After the American public noticed that something was going on, the narrative seeped into the media. In 2005, Thank You For Smoking was released7. The movie proposes an idea about questioning credibility. This is a similar narrative to questioning fake scientists. Except, in this case, we know that cigarettes are addictive and harmful, and so the character in the movie is spinning the argument of checking the validity of facts and putting that frame of questioning back on the valid facts. In other words, this movie is part of many that raise the question as to whether or not we, as the American people, can trust science.
However, not all media seems to be anti-science. As a counter example, the sitcom television series, The Big Bang Theory, which first aired in 2007, is all about scientists. Its a show with twelve seasons, and if the American sitcom watcher didnt like science, the show wouldnt have lasted for twelve years.
In the early 1960s, Michael Crichton was studying medicine, but he dropped out after being more inspired by writing. One of his first successes was Andromeda Strain. The book was released in 1968, and it was so successful that it inspired a film of the same name three years later in 1971. Andromeda Strain is a story about secret science and government weapons and control. A secret government probe was sent to out collect an alien virus in order to use it as a bioweapon. The probe crashed in a small rural town and killed everyone there. Scientists then have to struggle in order to save the world. Michael Crichton, perhaps motivated by his own separation with science, also wrote Jurassic Park. In Jurassic Park, which is more famous as the movie of the same name, scientists go too far and bring dinosaurs back to life. The dinosaurs destroy everything. The narratives of Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park both push a question into the readers mind, can you really trust the scientists?
The Turn
Around the time that we see the media start to pick up on the idea that scientists are no longer the heros nor the silent saviors--for example, Vietnam, the public put two and two together and realized that the scientists and fake scientists were actually all tangled up in the mix of the aforementioned companies cover ups--for example, ExxonMobils global warming crisis. So, the public realized that Big Tobacco companies and ExxonMobil were lying: nicotine is addictive, cigarettes cause cancer, burning fossil fuels causes global warming. When people found out about these issues, they were rightfully mad that no one was doing anything about them. So, to assuage people and keep the money flowing, companies had to obscure the narrative: they started the war on science, the war on the truth. In turn, this only loosened the bolts in the structure of truth that holds up science and scientists.
Nowadays, like the Swine Flu scare before it, the coronavirus pandemic has sparked rejection of vaccination. Yet, this time, unlike Swine Flu, the mistrust in science has had deadly consequences.
Modern Day
	Today, the war on science continues. One of the primary examples of an internet tribe with a harmful anti-science conspiracy theory is the anti-vaccine group.9 They have questioned many aspects of vaccines, such as ingredients8a and side effects8b. Any publicized and reproducible findings are denied as lies. and they weave their own story that ranges from vaccines causing infertility, death, and and injury8c Additionally, religion and the Gods ethos show up in their arguments too.8d
Conclusion
Looking back on how the war on science has evolved over time, at least one thing has remained constant: not trusting the science and the facts. Given the threat of the coronavirus pandemic that has affected the United States for nearly two years, the ever worsening effects of climate change on the environment trust in science and the truth becomes even more important. The war on science is almost the same as the war on information. It is only when we put our trust in the science thats trying to protect us we can save our planet and our species.

?PDR5 Deletion Lab Report
Abstract
When creating new medicines, we first must understand how the organisms causing ailments resist our medicines. Our experiment examined yeasts ability to grow without their PDR5 gene while being exposed to the antifungal clotrimazole, known as Fungicure. We hypothesized that the PDR5 gene gives yeast the ability to grow while exposed to Fungicure. A knockout cassette of the PDR5 gene with a KanMX marker, which is resistant to the G418 antibiotic, was added to yeast and plated onto a plate with YEPD+G418, in which only the experimental yeast that knocked out their PDR5 gene with KanMX was able to grow. After incubation, PCR was performed and visualized with two sets of primers, both including a primer in the KanMX gene, on the experimental and control yeast to determine if a knockout occurred. Finally, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Fungicure with a constant level of G418 was conducted on experimental and control yeast, which was already resistant to G418, to determine if the knockout of the PDR5 gene changes yeast susceptibility to Fungicure. The MIC of Fungicure in the yeast whose PDR5 gene was knocked out was significantly lower than in the control yeast. The experimental yeast did not grow at any level of Fungicure while the control yeast grew until the tube with the highest concentration of Fungicure. The results support our hypothesis that the PDR5 gene gives yeast the ability to grow in Fungicure. Yeast that had their PDR5 gene knocked out were unable to grow in levels of Fungicure that the control yeast could tolerate. One possibility for this change in resistance could be that the PDR5 gene codes for an enzyme that pumps drugs out of yeast. Our results suggest that, without PDR5, yeast may not be able to pump out drugs such as Fungicure, leading to decreased levels of yeast growth in Fungicure. Learning how yeast genes such as PDR5 protect yeast from drugs like Fungicure may help us create better medications to cure yeast-related ailments.

Figure 1a: Purified PCR product from different reactions of forward (FP) and reverse (RP) primers and yeast were loaded into a gel to visualize whether PCR occurred. Two combinations of forward and reverse primers were used to ensure the validity of the results. The reaction with the transformant and the 5 junction primers was measured at 578 bp. The reaction with the transformant and the 3 junction primers was measured at 886 bp. There was no product for either of the control reactions. 
Figure 1b: Model of PCR results in figure 1a at PDR5 location in the yeast genome. No product for the control reactions because no KanMX was present for primers to bond to. Product for transformants with present KanMX expected at 578 bp for 5 junction primers and 886 bp for 3 junction primers. The products seen for the transformants in figure 1a show that PDR5 was knocked out because KanMX was present. 
Figure 2: Results of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Fungicure between control yeast and yeast treated with knockout cassette. Each tube contained a medium for yeast growth (YEPD) and G418 antibiotic, which the control was already resistant to, and the experimental yeast was made resistant to with the knockout cassette containing the KanMX marker. Control yeast growth was present in all levels of Fungicure except the highest level. PDR5del yeast growth was only present in the tube with no Fungicure. ?
Yeast Mutation Lab Report
Abstract
Organisms that gain resistance to medicines pose a threat to human health. Our research evaluated the mutations in yeast that give it the greatest resistance to clotrimazole, also called Fungicure. We hypothesized that the yeast with the greatest resistance to Fungicure would be made more resistant through mutations in the pleiotropic drug response (PDR), specifically the PDR1, PDR3, and/or the PDR5 genes. Through several rounds of experimentation, the yeast that was most resistant to Fungicure was determined. Using PCR and Electrophoresis, the PDR1, PDR3, and PDR5 genes in the selected yeast were amplified and measured. The PDR1, PDR3, and PDR5 genes were sequenced and compared to sequences of the non-mutated yeast. Through comparison of the PDR1, PDR3, and PDR5 genesis of wild-type yeast and the mutate yeast, it was found that there was a single missense mutation in both the PDR3 and PDR5 genes. For PDR3, a Thr was substituted for an Ala at the 949th amino acid. For PDR5, an Arg was substituted for a Gln at the 517th amino acid. The mutations in the PDR3 and PDR5 genes of the yeast that was most resistant to clotrimazole support the hypotheses that these two genes cause yeast to have a greater resistance to Fungicure. PDR5 codes for an enzyme that pumps drugs out of the yeast while PDR3 codes for an enzyme that helps control PDR5. Because there was no mutation found in PDR1, it is unable to be determined whether PDR1 causes greater resistance to Fungicure. One cause of this increased resistance may be from the fact that the two mutations in these genes appear to have increased the yeasts resistance to Fungicure may suggesting that the mutations increased the effectiveness of the two enzymes that the two genes code for. 
Figures
Figure 1: Purified PCR samples from different genes were loaded into the gel to determine how many base pairs each gene had. PDR1 was measured at 834 pairs of nucleotides, PDR4 was measured at 379 nucleotides long and PDR5 was measured at 654 nuceotides long. 
Figure 2: Comparison of PDR gene sequences before and after mutation. Wild type sequences of PDR genes 3 and 5 are shown above the sequences of mutated genes. For PDR3, a Thr was substituted for an Ala at the 949th amino acid as a result of the A nucleotide being replaced with a G nucleotide. For PDR5, an Arg was substituted for a Gln at the 517th amino acid as a result of the G nucleotide being replaced with an A nucleotide. 
Figure 3: Process of Gel Electrophoresis. In Gel Electrophoresis, DNA fragments are loaded into a gel. Then the charged plate under the gel is turned on which creates a positively charged side and a negatively charged side. Because DNA is negatively charged, all fragments will travel from the negatively charged side to the positively charged side. Fragments that are shorter have less inertia, meaning that they will travel farther. This process allows the DNA fragments to be measured by length. 
?Language is probably one of the most important tools a person can have when it comes to being able to communicate with others. There is a reason humanity evolved to have language in the first place. Language itself gives people the ability to communicate with one another and share ideas, thoughts, and feelings, but language is also more than just communication. Language gives you an identity, a culture that is unique to whatever tribe they belong to. This same concept is brought about in Born a Crime by Trevor Noah, where he mentions that Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it (Noah 49). In the book, Trevor Noah uses this aspect of language to his advantage, becoming a sort of chameleon as he calls it. From what is depicted in Born a Crime, Trevor Noahs assertion that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people is accurate because language is one of the only things that can reverse/change initial opinions about someone.
During the beginning of the book, Trevor mentions that his mother taught him several languages, such as English, Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans. In growing up during apartheid, Trevor saw how his mother used language to cross racial barriers, and began learning about the power of language at a young age. For example, Trevor mentions how one time when he and his mother were in a shop, the shopkeeper spoke to the security guard in Afrikaans to Follow those blacks in case they steal something (Noah 55). Instead of ignoring the shop owner, Trevors mother spun around and replied Why dont you follow these blacks so you can help them find what theyre looking for? (Noah 55). To Trevors surprise, the shopkeeper then apologized for aiming his racism at [them] (Noah 55). Trevor then learned to use language the way his mother did, using language to cross racial barriers. He even later uses his skill to get out of being mugged because of his skin color! As Trevor began to learn, by speaking the same language as someone else, you immediately create a bond with them, showing them that you arent a stranger. By speaking someone else's language, you are showing them that you are part of their tribe, which can even reverse the initial impression that they may have had one you, such as with Trevor and his mom in the shop.
Even though all languages are a form of communication, some forms of language are perceived as more valuable than others. Towards the beginning of the book, Trevor Noah mentions that his mother made him learn English as his first language rather than learning their home language. Trevor later explains that  If you're black in South Africa, speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up. English is the language of money. English comprehension is equated with intelligence (Noah 54). In other words, in South Africa, English is valued higher than other languages just because it is the language of the privileged. So even though Trevor Noah makes that claim that knowing many languages can help bridge the race gap, there are some languages that are valued more than others (Noah 54). Yet, the unfortunate thing is that not everyone speaks higher valued languages like English, leading to unequal access to opportunities.
In his book Born a Crime, Trevor Noah asserts that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people, and he has proven this to be true through his own personal experiences (p. 56). However, he also has shown that there are some languages that are valued more than others, and the languages of opportunity tend to be the languages spoken by those who are privileged. Language is a way to show the world who you are, or at least a way to give it a perception of who you are. When Trevor Noah uses his linguistic skills to become a chameleon, he gains the ability to have multiple identities and cultures, and even gains the ability to cross the racial barrier. So even though language may just be a way for human beings to communicate to one another, there is ironically an unspoken element about language as Trevor Noah has proven to be real. ?Rubric:

Prompt:
Trevor Noah asserts that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people (56). Do you agree with Trevors assessment of the importance of language? What do his claims suggest about the power of language and the values placed on certain languages over others?
Trevor Noah recalls that he remembers most scenes of his life in English, regardless of what language they were originally spoken in. Noah says that the ability to speak a language is an identity that transcends racial boundaries. Speaking different languages allowed Trevor Noah to navigate his way through a world that, according to Noah, viewed him as an outsider (140). Noah was able to speak the other groups language in order to fit in with their identity. So, the proper language used with the corresponding people can overcome pre-instantiated racial prejudice. More generally, in some situations, certain languages have more power than others.
Trevor Noahs family was quite religious. Every Sunday, his mother tried to go to three different churches. Consequently, Trevor was exposed to lots of praying. Noahs grandmother was also quite religious, she believed in demons and curses too. Trevors grandmother had told Trevor that his prayers, when performed in English, had more bearing and influence on Jesus because, according to Trevors grandmother, he spoke English (40). Trevor believed his grandmother, I believed in the power of prayer. I know that my prayers worked (46-47). This was Trevors first experience with attuning his communication to match with the person with whom he was communicating: English to Jesus. Trevor didnt arrive upon this idea on his own, his mother also knew how to code-switch with language to better deal with situations.
On time, Trevor and his mother were in a store and the clerk told his security guards, in Afrikaans, to watch out for Trevor and his mother, to make sure they dont steal anything. Trevors mother retorted in Afrikaans that she wanted assistance instead. Then the store clerk apologized. However Trevor Noah notes that the clerk, 
didnt apologize for being racist; he merely apologized for aiming his racism at us. [...] He said, I thought you were like the other blacks. You know how they love to steal (55). Because of her ability to speak Afrikaans, the language of [the] oppressor, Trevors mother was able to alter the store clerks opinion of her from being an other black person, who love[s] to steal, to a different kind of black person, one to whom the store clerk didnt have to be racist toward (55). Trevors mother overcame the racial animosity of the store clerk by merely speaking his same language. Trevor concludes, comparing racism to code programmed into the human body, that racism says that people arent like you if they dont look like you, but that they are like you if they talk like you (50). So, in the mind of a racist person, interacting with a person who speaks their language but doesnt look like them will cause serious pause and confusion. The tool of language is useful for convincing people youre like them regardless of whether it is used to upshift or downshift your social status.
Trevor claims that he learned to use language just like his mother did. For example, he was walking down the street and he heard people plotting in Zulu to mug him. They thought that he was a rich white guy. Trevor turned around and said, in Zulu, Yo, guys, why dont we just mug someone together? (55). Trevor avoided an altercation by showing the Zulu guys, as Trevor refers to them, that, even though he looked white, he was really like them because he spoke ZuluAs Trevor mentions later in the chapter, The Cheese Boys, he was, hood, and not, cheese. In other words, he could empathize with the Zulu guys on levels aside from a language. In order to learn the language, Trevor didnt sit in a classroom, he shared the same experiences of the native speakers from each of their respective worlds. Before he went to H. A. Jack Primary school, he lived in separate worlds, each with their own racial and language identity.
Trevor Noah wrote about his first experience being on the playground at the multi-race H. A. Jack Primary school. Trevor said, I was eleven years old, and it was like I was seeing my country for the first time [...] In an instant I could see, I could feel, how the boundaries were drawn. Groups moved in color (57). Trevor saw firsthand the dividing force of segregation. However, once again with the power of language, he was able to navigate in between the playground groups just by speaking their same language. As Trevor remarked, to others it seemed like a colored kid speaking black languages was the most amazing trick (58). Because of his repertoire of language, Trevor was able to fit in with every different group, one group at a time.
	In summary, Trevor Noah demonstrates that speaking the right language gives the ability to switch between groups, whether they be oppressive or not, as well as speak directly to anyone as an equal. And, most importantly these advantages of language are present regardless of any other dividing racial identity. As Trevor Noah concludes, maybe I didnt look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you (56).?INTRODUCCIN:
Se llama as por la influencia de los Moros, una civilizacin de frica del Noroeste quienes vivieron en esta regin por 500 aos, Andaluca es una comunidad de Espaa tan diversa. Mucho de la cultura rica llega de los races moros, pero, al mismo tiempo, hay tensin alrededor de la colonizacin e identidad. Como dijo un artculo de Georgetown University, Andaluca es "Una regin orgullosa llena de hipocresa." Esta yuxtaposicin entre las dos partes de la identidad Andaluz es fascinante.
Andaluca est situada en el Sur del pas, cerca de Morocco y el Mediterranio. Esta ubicacin, adems de la tierra rica y diversa, es una regin tan atractiva para la conquista (en el pasado) y el turismo (hoy).

My Humble Opinion on Journalism Being Regulated in the U.S.
The Dalai Lama once said Know the rules well, so you can break them effectively. Rules themselves are seen as a form of regulation from the general public. In fact, the definition of a rule from Oxford Languages is ??one of a set of explicit or understood regulations []. In every society, there are those who follow the rules, and then there are those who break the rules, but what some people often choose to neglect is why rules and regulations exist in the first place. In the realm of journalism, for example, there exists a set of core values, in other words a set of regulations. However, similar to society, there are those who follow these regulations, and there are those who do not. But how could one prevent journalists from straying from these core values? But before we can even begin to answer this question, we must first answer whether journalism should be regulated in the U.S. or not.
Journalism can be viewed as the act of spreading news and information to the public, which is a very important task. However, if the information that journalists spread is inaccurate, this can lead to a number of problems. Because of this flaw, there exists a set of core values for journalists to follow to prevent misinformation. Some core values include: Accuracy, Independence, Impartiality, and Humanity. Unfortunately, not every journalist follows these guidelines, which in turn leads to biased news and flat out lies being published. With this kept in mind, it seems perfectly reasonable that journalism be regulated in the U.S.. The regulation of journalism wouldnt hurt anyone except those creating fake news... right?
Unfortunately, the world is not that simple. Let me start off by saying that there have already been attempts by the federal government to regulate the press, and it has never ended well. One example of this is when the Pentagon Papers were published, and the Federal Government attempted to prevent the New York Times from continuing to publish the papers (because they were classified). The court case went all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the final ruling was that freedom of the press was protected by the first amendment. After this court case, it became clear that the federal government couldnt regulate the press, for that would violate the first amendment. 
However, even though the federal government cannot regulate the press, the general public can. With the advancement of technology, people have been able to fact check information easier. This ability to fact check from the public makes it extremely crucial for well-respected news sources to ensure their information is accurate, because even if one mistake is caught, it can severely impact their credibility. This desire for credibility and trust is mainly what keeps the media in check, and essentially what regulates journalism to a certain degree. However, even with this in mind, there are still exceptions to this (e.g. Fox News). But should journalism be regulated more than it already is?
All in all, regulating Journalism is more complex than one might think at first glance. There are ethical issues when it comes to restricting freedom of the press, but also ethical issues around publishing inaccurate information. There are two sides to every story. With this in mind, I think that the press should be regulated, but to a certain degree. There should always be exceptions, and when it comes to regulating something that is supposed to be free, there are always challenges involved. However, I believe that with the right guidance, regulation of the press (to a certain extent) could benefit the general public and reestablish trust in the media (something the U.S. currently struggles with). If something isnt done soon to reestablish trust in the media, the publics faith in the government, particularly in the election system, will continue to decline. This is because after all, trust and faith are essential elements of a functional society, and without them, all chaos breaks loose.

 ?Msica
Proyecto Final
	Hoy, la msica de Flamenco est conectada con una cultura vibrante, rica con pasin y ritmo. Cuando piensas sobre Espaa, la msica de Flamenco es la partitura de su viaje imaginarioPersonas bailando, cantando, y tocando una forma de arte tan contagiosa. La verdad, como es el caso frecuentemente, es que la historia y contexto de Flamenco en la identidad Espaola es ms compleja que esta versin idealizada.
	Aunque el Flamenco, naci en el Sur de Espaa en Andaluca, es un smbolo cultural de Espaa, al principio, esta forma de expresin era despreciada. Muchas Espaolas pensaron que el Flamenco era una mancha cultural que no representa los valores y logros de una Espaa moderna. La creacin y presentacin del Flamenco es a menudo asociada con los Gitanos Roman. Para las Espaolas lites, el Flamenco sintetiz el remordimiento sobre la prdida de poder y estado en el mundo moderno. Ellos piensan que este tipo de entretenimiento era una distraccin que permiti a la sociedad ignorar las problemas ms urgentes del pas como corrupcin, desigualdad educacional y riqueza, y una falta de infraestructura esencial a un pas moderno.
	La historia del Flamenco es fascinante, pero algo ms fascinante es la forma de arte especficamente. El Flamenco tiene races y ritmos tan complejos. La forma de arte tiene tres componentes especficos que definen el gnero: el toque, cante, y baile. El toque es el acompaamiento del cante con las guitarras. El estilo de tocando la guitarra es por rasgueando y haciendo trmolo a las cuerdas para aadir intensidad al mensaje musical. El cante es la parte ms importante porque lo expresa el cuento. Finalmente, hay baile. Esta es la parte que algunas personas de Espaa piensan que es muy obscena, pero al mismo tiempo, es la parte que es la representacin visual de la msica. Este tipo de baile especficamente requiere muchos aos de estudiar porque es muy complejo.
	En conclusin, el Flamenco no voy a morir. Resiliencia es una parte ncleo a la ADN de la cultura de Andaluca, y el Flamenco es un reflejo de esta espritu social. En el pasado, regimenes diferentes han probado a apagar el mensaje del Flamenco. Pero lo tiene races en culturas oprimidas, y por esta razn, lo puede cambiar a se quede relevante ahora, y en el futuro. Opresin no voy a terminar, entonces el Flamenco no voy a parar. El Flamenco es sobre mucho ms del msicaes sobre tener una voz.

Proyecto Final
Gobierno
Puedes aprender mucho sobre un lugar por estudiando la poltica y gobierno de esta regin. El sistema de gobierno de Andaluca hoy, el gobierno autnomo, se construy en los 1980s. Andaluca es parte de una coleccin de 17 comunidades autnomas en Espaa. Las partes del Gobierno Regional son el Parlamento de Andaluca, el presidente, un consejo, y otros grupos que forman el sistema. En esta jerarqua, el presidente tiene mucho poder e influencia como el representante de la comunidad en muchas formas.
Hipocresa
Donde hay cosas fascinantes es en la historia del sistema y en las influencias culturales que forman el gobierno y el sentimiento pblico hoy. Un buen ejemplo de esto es la religin. En Andaluca, Judasmo, Cristianismo, y Islam hay muy prevalente. Esta mezcla de ideologas es tan rica y es una caracterstica que define la regin. La presencia de la cultura rabe y de personas de frica del Norte en esta parte de la pennsula de Espaa tiene impactos grandesla comida, la msica, el arcoiris de diversidad. Pero, al mismo tiempo, Andaluca es un gran centro de catolicismo tambin. La gran contradiccin de Andaluca es en su relacin con la parte de su herencia rabe y africana. El arte, la cultura, y las ideas y perspectivas nuevas que son la fundacin de Andaluca, la parte que es el orgullo nacional de la regin, llega de las partes de su identidad (rabe y africana). Pero, este es la seccin que los ciudadanos de Andaluca no puedes mantener es su propios valores culturales hoy.
Poltica Hoy
Con toda esta informacin, podemos entender el clima poltica de Andaluca mejor. Andaluca est en una posicin fascinante entre tradicionalismo y diversidad. Hay ideas estrictas sobre roles de gnero y sus posicin nacional. Naturalmente los demogrficos variados resultan en cambio ineludibles. Recientemente, un grupo muy conservativo obtuvo poder e influencia en Andaluca. Esto es incomprensible porque Andaluca tiene una reputacin de socialism. Esto representa un cambio muy grande en la tela social de Andaluca.

?Argyle: Dreaming about being attacked by a scissor/seam ripper
Cue sunrise
Cue day bedroom
Argyle: Wakes up scared breathing heavily Oh my god, what a scary dream! I wonder what it could mean? Is this going to happen to me?I wonder if there are any scientists that I can talk to who will answer my questions?
Cue lab to show the two scientists arguing no rat theory is correct, no auto therapy is correct?
Argyle: hey you two, do you possibly know if dreams have meaning? I had a very scary dream and im worried that something like that might actually happen to me
RAT and second scientist: We are the dream scientists, here to tell you about dreams.
Snake scientist: I think that dreams have meaning. People used to believe that dreams were coded messages from gods or the dreamers psyche. Nowadays we have different ideas. My colleagues and I have three big theories on the meanings of dreams.``
Snake scientist: Our first theory is that dreams help us sort new experiences into short term and long term memories so that our brain is better organized. Our second theory  is dream Autotherapy! Some of us believe that we dream as a way to cope with the things going on in our daily lives, whether that be anxiety you are facing in your daily life, trauma from past experience, fear, all formed by stories that our brain creates. Our final theory is that dreams help us dispose of useless information we have collected. These researchers think we dream to forget. Despite these differences, all of my colleagues and I believe that dreams are meaningful!
RAT: Thats ridiculous! You should listen to my theory instead. It is called RAT, or Random Activation Theory. Us RATs believe that dreams are completely random and have no significance. We think that the images you see in your head while you are dreaming are your brain trying to interpret the random signals generated by your brain while you are sleeping. Thinking that dreams have any meaning is absurd when you consider how random they are!
Snake scientist: How foolish of you! How could dreams be random if dreams have a story structure and are somewhat coherent? And because the body has a mechanism to prevent itself from reacting in dreams, why do we have dreams in the first place if they are not only useless but also potentially dangerous? Your theory makes no sense! 
RAT: Why you!
They attack each other
Argyle: Well that was interesting. I sure have a lot to consider when it comes to my dreams, it seems like even though dreams seem so real, it could just be our brain processing information and anxieties, wow thats alot of theories, Thank you scientists!

A: We dream to cope with our world. 
Q: What is the third theory the snake proposes?
A: We dream to forget. 
Q: What does the snake and all their colleagues fundamentally believe about dreams? 
A: Dreams have meaning.
Q: What does RAT stand for and what does it mean?
A:  Random Activation Theory. Dreams are the brain interpreting random signals. 
Q: What are the two main counterpoints to the RAT theory? 
A: Dreams have story structure and coherence. Dreams would have been bred out of the genepool if they were both useless and potentially dangerous. ?Role Writeup
Role: Researcher
As the researcher, my role was primarily to gather and organize information for our video. At the beginning when the project was announced, I shared a google doc and created different sections for our brainstorming, notes, script, and sources. We first brainstormed our ideas for events and countries we might want to cover. Then as I wrote these down we realized we should first work on defining our terms to make sure were on the same page. Collectively we researched terms related to journalism such as free press, fake news, censorship, etc. The next class period we had, we discussed the definitions we wanted to use for our video and I wrote those down. 
As we began researching examples of the war on journalism we decided that it would be better to cover journalism in a couple countries instead of talking about isolated events in many countries. Someone brought up the idea of each of us focusing on a single country and covering its history and we all agreed. I created separate sections on the google doc for each country and we started researching independently. Then when we had work time we would talk about what we learned and I helped give suggestions on possible topics they could research and found relevant articles about them. I also put all of our sources together at the end of the document so its easier to create the bibliography once we start making the video. 
During this project, my strengths were keeping our documents organized and helping my group find articles. For example, I proposed that Alex could talk about the interference of Russia in the US elections to connect our two topics. I found articles from the American news sites as well as explaining how the Russian media portrayed this based on their news sites. One area of growth is my communication with the members. Although we each focused on separate countries, we should have discussed how to better connect our ideas to help our video flow. Since this was the first time I was working on a long video with a group, I underestimated the level of communication we needed to effectively work as a team.
?Jill Lepore makes the case that liberalism is a needed antidote to nationalism. Do you disagree? Why? What would you consider to be an alternative? 
If you agree, why? What would you consider the proper role of liberalism to be?
In Jill Lepores This America, she explains the origins of nations, offers a brief history of American nationalism [and argues] against nationalism, and for liberalism. First and foremost, these two ideologies of nationalism and liberalism need to be defined. Both nationalism and liberalism share the same origins, yet differ greatly despite it. (27,40). Before defining nationalism, we must first understand what a nation is. Lepore defines a nation as a political community, governed by laws, that at least theoretically, unites a people who share common origins, as if they were a family. (26). However, she also notes that, in practice, a nation consists of many different people from different places and origins. (26). That being said, nationalism is the unhealthy attachment to ones country, so much so that it means less a love for your own country than a hatred of other countries and their people and a hatred of people within your own country who dont belong to an ethnic, racial, or religious majority. (23). In summary, nationalism promotes attachment to a particular place, by insisting on national distinctions. (41). A key example of nationalism in America comes from George Bancroft who first wrote about the idea of manifest destiny, which Lepore defines as an Americans sense of their God-given right to cross the continent. (35). While it might not seem like manifest destiny was motivated out of hatred for the lands or people, Lepore notes that, in fact, the nationalism that Goerge Bancroft set about cultivating [...] was part of this larger nineteenth-century project of storing the worlds people into nationalities. [...] Bancrofts history aimed to promote a feeling of national attachment. (37). While nationalism promotes division and isolation, (92). Liberalism invites the opposite. Lepore defines liberalism as the belief that people are good and should be free, and that people erect governments in order to guarantee that freedom. (40). In short, liberalism is about freedom and democracy. (41). An example of applied liberalism, that of a liberal nation, comes from French history. King Louis XIV stated, Ltat, cest moi, meaning I am the state. (40). Lepore notes how these words were changed very slightly to show the idea of liberalism. The state became the people, Ltat, cest nous. [(The state is us)] (41). This statement, the state is us, demonstrates the a liberal nations idea that all individuals have an equal right to participate in government. (131). So, while nationalism is about separation, liberalism is about unison. Since nationalism seeks to divide Americans and to enforce segregation, the best solution is a recognition and inclusion of difference.
Lepore also mentions the existence of two types of nationalism, liberal and illiberal nationalism. Liberal nationalism is the confusion between liberalism and nationalism, some political scientists have even called it an oxymoron. (130). An example of what is deemed to be Liberal nationalism comes from a quote by President Roosevelt. He said, There is no room for the hyphen in our citizenship. (83). This means that one can be either an American or not. Roosevelt wanted everyone to be a part of one national identity and no other. Opposing this viewpoint, sociologist W. E. B. DuBois wrote, [The African American] simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both [black] and an [American]. (83). DuBois was asking to be part of a national identity, but retain his individual one. This type of liberalism can also be seen in the establishment of the United Nations [The United Nations] adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [...] Historians started writing histories that could foresee this beginning as an ending. They needed to find an origin story for internationalism, and for human rights, and for the triumph of liberalism. (100-101). A nation is united by its origins and history. A world united by a global history becomes a single nation. Nationalism cannot exist in a world with only one nation. However, the United Nations is plural. So while a single nation might be dystopian, nations can still cooperate together on the basis that All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. (Universal Declaration of Human Rights). And finally, as Lepore summarizes liberalism, Americans are bound by our past, but even more powerfully, we are bound to one another. (136). In other words, this means that liberalism that unites people based on their values--like life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--is more powerful than nationalism that divides people based upon their origins. This should be the role of liberalism: to hold values over origins.Quote Bank
When serious historians abandon the study of the nation, when scholars stop trying to write a common history for a popel, nationalism doesnt die. Instead, it eats liberalism. (20).
Nationalism had come to mean something different from patriotism, something fierce, something violent: less a love for your own country than a hatred of other countries and their people and a hatred of people within your own country who dont belong to an ethnic, racial, or religious majority. (23).
Louis Snyder, a City College of New York professor who witnessed the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1920s, once explained why, in a book called The Meaning of Nationalism. Nationalist, he observed, have a vested interest in maintaining a vagueness of language as a cloak for their aims. Because its difficult to convince people to pursue a course of aggression, violence, and domination, requiring sacrifices made in the name of the nation, nationalist pretend their aims are instead protection and unity and that their motivation is patriotism. (23-24).
Patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred. (24).
A state is a political community, governed by laws; a nation-state is a political community, governed by laws, that at least theoretically, unites a people who share common origins, as if they were a family. In practice, though, a nation-state does not ordinarily unite a people who share common descent by geography at birth; instead it gathers together all sorts of people, from many different places and lines of descent (26).
Nationalism, when it emerged, was a product of the Enlightenment, and a species of liberalism. (27). Nineteenth-century nationalism and modern liberalism were formed out of the same clay. (40).
American nationalism is distinctive, in part, because of the strange manner in which the nation was formed. (28).
Its useful to think of the United States not as a nation-state but instead as something stranger, a state-nation. (33).
The language of nationalism, when it surfaced in the United States in the 1830s, had less to do with feelings of national belonging To be a nationalist meant to advocate for the power of the federal government.
Uniting history George Bancroft promoted idea of manifest destiny, Americans sense of their God-given right to cross the continent. (35).
Bancroft wanted the nation to appear older to give it more dignity and more authority and also, simply, more history. (36). history to unite a people
The nationalism that Goerge Bancroft set about cultivating  was part of this larger nineteenth-century project of storing the worlds people into nationalities. (37).
Bancrofts history aimed to promote a feeling of national attachment. (37).
Liberalism is the belief that people are good and should be free, and that people erect governments in order to guarantee that freedom. (40).
Ltat, cest moi, Louis XIV is said to have proclaimed WIth the rise of liberal nation-states, the state became the people: it required their consent, Ltat, cest nous. (40-41).
Liberalism embraced a set of aspirations about liberty and democracy believed to be universal. (41).
Nationalism promotes attachment to a particular place, by insisting on national distinctions. (41).
Liberal nationalists saw becoming a nation and belonging to a nationality as necessary and even inevitable steps on a path of moral, social, and political progress. (43-44).
Liberal nationalism rested on an analogy between the individual and the collective. Just as liberals had faith in dividuals, so they had faith in nations. That faith rested on the idea that the equal rights of individuals can only be guaranteed by their becoming the citizens of nations: thats what hitched liberalism to nationalism. No nations, no constitutions; no constitutions, no citizens; no citizens, no rights. (44).
The American Civil War was a struggle between two nationalisms. [...] Southern nationalism [...] would be termed illiberal, or ethinic. (57).
By good nationalism, they usually mean liberal or civic nationalism, an attachment to a set of civic ideals. By bad nationalism, they usually mean illiberal or ethnic nationalism, nativism, racism, and recourse to aggression. [...] American nationalism is both. (58).
Illiberal nationalism is often thought of as what happens when a nation-state demands extraordinary sacrifices from its people--especially by participation in wars of aggression. (71).
To restrict immigraiton, a practice associated with the rise of illiberal nationalism, is to regard foreigners who arrive from friendly nations as invading armies. (72).
The growth of illiberal nationalism was also very closely tied to the growth of populism (73).
W. E. B. DeBois wrote, [The African American] simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both [black] and an [American]. (83). There is no room for the hyphen in our citizenship, [Theodore] Roosevelt said. (83).
Illiberal nationalism [is manifested] as isolationism. (92).
The uglier and more illiberal nationalism got, the more liberal intellectuals became convinced of the impossibility of liberal nationalism. And yet in the 1930s, even as liberals in the UNited States despaired over the future of liberal democracy , they also exerted themselves to defend liberalism by confronting nationalism. (95).
American dream 96
The United Nations was established in 1945, a new league of nations. [...] its general assembly adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [...] Historians started writing histories that could foresee this beginning as an ending. They needed to find an origin story for internationalism, and for human rights, and for the triumph of liberalism. (100-101).
Nationalism was blamed for the onset of war in 1939. (103).
The Immigration Act marked a brief midcentury reunification of liberalism and nationalism. (117). Undid previous exclusionary nationalistic actions of the origin-based quotas of the Immigration Act of 1924 replaced with country quotas
A liberal dream of a better America was derailed by Lyndon B Johnsons commitment to waging a war in Vietnam, which divided the country and set in motion the political polarization that diminished liberalism by spurring the rise of both a New Left and a New Right. (118).
The death of nationalism had been the dream of internationalists at least since the introduction of the League of Nations in 1918. (119-120). Predictions of the waning of nationalism
[In the United States,] A politics of identity replaced a politics of nationality. (127).
Nation-states are people with a common past, often a mythical one, who live under the rule of a government in the form of a state. Liberal nations are people who understand themselves as individual political equals, each with an equal right to participate in government. (131).
In American history, liberals have failed [...] to defeat illiberalism except by making appeals to national aims and ends. (131).
Political scientist Judith Shklar deemed liberal nationalism to be an oxymoron. (130).
Americans are bound by our past, but even more powerfully, we are bound to one another. (136).?The War on Terror was framed as such because the overwhelming majority of people agree that terror, as a concept, is a horrible thing that should be stopped. Because of the universality of this opinion, citizens of the United States were more inclined to agree with any effort to fight terror because they would appear as bad people if they objected to the means the government would take to end terror. This gave the government, especially the executive branch, the freedom to use any means to fight terror, no matter how horrific or destructive. In this case, framing the War on Terror as a war on an abstract concept was incredibly effective in getting the public approval to use executive power. 
The War on Journalism is framed as a war to justify discrediting and silencing the press. Although it is not explicitly framed as a War on Journalism in the same way the War on Terror and the War on Drugs are, leaders like Putin and Trump still actively work to paint journalists in a negative light as enemies of the people and spreaders of fake news. Putins case is the most direct, going so far as to jail independent journalists and label them as criminals. Although Trump is not as direct in waging the War on Journalism, he still actively works to discredit them so that his supporters do not trust their reporting. This is as effective as outlawing journalism altogether or jailing journalists who dont support them because it destroys public trust in journalists and makes obscures truth. Trumps method works in a democracy such as the United States because his method is more tolerable to the majority of people and is much harder to prevent. 
The only people who benefit from suppressing journalism are the individuals who actively suppress it. The populations of countries do not benefit from having less access to alternative viewpoints. In Putins case, he has restricted the viewpoints of his entire country. By doing this, he has successfully been in power since 2000. Trump focuses more on his supporters and audience and convinces them to ignore all journalism that is neutral or negative towards him and only focus on the news sources that paint him in a very positive light. His fan base is large enough so that he has a significant percentage of the population to manipulate. This came most sharply in focus on January 6th during the insurrection. Trump's tactics do not benefit journalism, the general public, or Democracy in the United States. They do not even serve his supporters because they do not receive any direct benefits and the fervor he ignites in them places them in physical and mental danger.  
Overall, individual leaders wage a War on Journalism against journalists to curate the opinions that their audience has about them. They do this to further control their audience, whether it is an entire country or citizens that support them. As a result, these individuals gain more power and keep that power. The War on Journalism only benefits these individual leaders and harms almost everyone else. ?For the film poster, I chose to focus on division and humanity. The image of the border shows how North and South Korea is physically divided while the overlay of the hands shows how the divide impacted the individual citizens and that there is a desire for reunification among people who had their families divided. Human hands also demonstrate the basic humanity that all the characters in the story possess while the fact that the hands are shadows shows that this humanity is repressed in North Korea. The background of the people shows how many people are impacted by the divide on both sides. I chose to highlight humanity as the title of the book can have multiple interpretations. While it directly refers to the fact that without the Great Leader there is not North Korea, it can also refer to the fact that without the South Korean people there are no North Korean people as the split broke apart families and communities and still leaves a wound in both countries. 
	I chose a bold sans font for the poster to show how bare the divide is. When the author is in North Korea, the divide seems to her very raw and open. Even though her students are covering many things up, the connection she has with them is clear and emotional. The bold font shows both how in-your-face the divide is in the book and highlights the human connection the author has with the students. 
	The colors are subdued to match the feeling of baldness the author experiences in North Korea. In her time there, everything in North Korea and Pyongyang are described as muted and gray, from the buildings to the food. The red tint over everything highlights the emotional weight of the story as well as the hidden bloodshed that runs beneath North Korea. The red highlight of the Demilitarization Zone draws in the eye and catches the attention of the viewer. Additionally, the highlight directly implies the importance of the divide.
	For the quote, I chose, "The wall between us was impossible to break down, not only that, it was permanent" (Kim, 257). This quote is useful because it directly relates to the emotional barriers which are pertinent to the story. It teases this idea of walls without explicitly stating what they are specifically, which intrigues the viewer without spoiling the story.  The quote both reflects the division as well as the desire for connection and humanity, however futile it may be. 
	The PG-13 rating works best for this film because while there is not much explicit content, the story is very weighty for younger viewers. Additionally, there are references to sexual harassment, eating of dogs, starvation, extreme poverty, concentration camps, and executions. Thus, parental guidance is strongly recommended.  
?India is now at a crucial point in deciding whether it wants to commit to the way it wants the world to view it. If it wants to become a technological center of the world, it will have to work to dismantle the caste system, at least on an economic level if not on a social level. This is the only way to expand India's technological center as currently, only a small percentage of the population that is in the higher castes has access to these jobs, and many of them are exported. By reducing the importance of the caste system, India will be able to industrialize in a more typical manner.
 In the meanwhile, India must commit to farmers to avoid economic collapse. As the farmer's protests are beginning to end after a year, some changes are beginning. For example, farmers have just gotten Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal three farming laws that were hurting small farmers. While this is a good first step, it is unclear whether Mr. Modi will continue to meet farmer demands and enact new laws to help them. Without proper action, farmers, and by extent, the economy will continue to suffer and induce more unrest. 
Mr. Modi, who has always projected himself as a very muscular and uncompromising figure with a "Hindu-focused nationalist agenda", is now starting to appear weaker to the public as his popularity wanes. His identity in the eyes of the Indian people and the outcome of the 2024 Indian general election will greatly affect the direction India takes to farmers and industrialization. 
?In my group, I was the editor of the script and video. Towards the beginning of this project, I did less work than my group mates because there wasnt much to edit. During this time I did some minor research to help our Researcher. As we began to finalize the script and begin recording, I started to edit more and record a majority of the script. I had some conflict with our group Lead/Storyteller over some of the edits I made, but in the end, we were able to come to a consensus. 
	I put the entire video together and did all the finalization and exportation in terms of video editing. My teammates worked on finding visuals and music to add to the recorded script and I lined everything up in iMovie to make sure it all flowed smoothly. The video editing took a majority of my time because I had to adjust a lot of the clip timing to stay within our time limit. Additionally, I had to cut out parts of the audio recordings that included long pauses or stuttering. In the end, we were able to create a video that was engaging and told a story about the War on Journalism.
	Our group worked very well together. We were all committed to finishing our project and each of us actively wanted to help out. I chose a role that matched my skill set and knowledge. We ran into some disagreements a few times but never had huge conflicts that stalled our work. The largest difficulty we encountered was that WeVideo was not working so my group mates were unable to watch the video while I was working on it in iMovie. This hurt our group communication but we got around it by showing parts of the video in study hall and I sent screen recordings to our group chat featuring drafts of the video. 
	From doing this video, I found multiple ways I could improve my work in the future. Overall, I need to be more proactive about getting things done. I dragged my feet on recording the audio and had to rush at the end. If I had been more proactive, I would have had time to re-record some clips to sound more professional. This was partly because my house is usually too loud to record until my family has gone to bed, but I should have worked harder to find a quiet place to record audio. Another thing I would have done differently is working more to flesh out the end parts of our video to have more analysis. We definitely focused more on the beginning part of the video (Vietnam) and were less thorough in the later sections. Finally, we should have become scripting at the same time we were finding visuals so that the visuals were more incorporated into the audio and did not seem separate. 
	Overall, I think our video was very successful in conveying our War and was pretty engaging. I learned a lot by making this video and will take the parts we could have improved into consideration for future group projects. ?War on Science Video Project

Reflection: Story Teller & Editor
How I Felt Starting the Project
To begin with, I think it was a bit difficult to find momentum to start this project. There were many different tiny snowballs of ideas that we had to filter through to find which one to roll down the hill into our video. More specifically, I think we had some good structure with the very beginning of the project, with submitting a concrete block of information on terms and origins and also the starting and ending points of our story. However, after that point, there weren't any incremental submissions to kind of keep track of our work progress, so I think we lagged behind a little in starting the actual crafting and drafting of our script. However, once I realized that Arlie, Ian, and I had less time left than I thought it would take to complete the project, we put the history project at the top of our figurative pilie homework--although to be honest, looking back, we didnt have that much homework.
Role Objectives
As an insert note, the items in the project I was responsible for was:
-drafting the script content,
-polishing the script flow and word choice--and related to this finding a tone to speak the script in,
-recording myself reading the script,
-editing together the recordings and adding text graphics and including images
Role Objectives Completion
	It is only now in the reflection process that I concretely outlined all the role objectives that I needed to accomplish. If I had done this previously, I could have turned the objectives into a task list.
	However, all the tasks that I have done line up with the objectives of the storyteller and editor roles, so things worked out well in the end. But, I think it would have been better if I had made a checklist beforehand.
	So, for next time, make a task checklist. While I didnt create such a checklist for my role, we did have a checklist-like document for the entire group project, in which I included some of the tasks that I needed to complete. So, by not separating to-do tasks into individual and personal lists, we dissolved the role lines a little bit. In addition to this, Arlie helped in drafting the script as well.
Work Process
	The process of generating our script, which, I think, was really the main sustenance of the project--due to the video being more of a secondary way of presenting the information, began with a clustered document of ideas. I wont go into too much detail about the process, because thats neither interesting to read about nor relevant to the reflection queries. Either way, I think that Arlie, Ian, and I worked well with compiling disorganized ideas into a single location. The next task that was difficult was to organize those ideas and factoids and decide on a narrative order. I think our work process was correct in that it was helpful to us, but I think we shouldve made time goals and objectives set more aggressively, so we didnt end up turning in our project late. However, by the end, Arlie and Ian couldnt really help me in the editing process, so I had to make sure I met the deadlines--at least the grace period deadlines--by myself, which I could see how that could have been stressful for them, given that they had little control over the project at that point.
What I Learned (Or Reinforced My Knowledge of) for Future Projects With Little In-Person Interaction
Work Order
	I realized that having a good plan for the order of work is important so people know what to do at what time.
Organization
I learned that having organizational measures such as different documents for different components of the project, can greatly improve workflow and efficiency. I didnt really have time to meet with my fellow group members outside of school, so any work that required lots of clarity around, this is what Im going to do/am doing, this is what Id like you to do. So, I think having a planner role, or actually if everyone had worked together on it, somehow making a plan for who needs to do what by when.
	Also, sorry to drag on this tangential reflection for too long, but my experience with organizing our work in this group project was similar to that of another experience I had working on a programming project. One of the main struggles of the programming project was that I didnt have a lot of time to sit down and talk with my partner in person, and so coming up with strategies of communication through the work, such as commenting or texting were essential in order to figure out how to best do the project.?Instructions:
We have been discussing Seattle, roads, crime, and some Indigenous history.
We will go more into all of these issues moving forward. For now, I want you to write a 500-600 word essay on what you think Seattle should do to become a better city moving forward, in regards to any of the topics that we have covered so far.
This could mean you say "more bike lanes!" or "more indigenous art" or "a bridge, just....a working bridge for West Seattle, come on now." Regardless of what you choose, you must provide evidence from the articles we have read and discussed.
You can be creative here, in fact you should be, as the one constant about Seattle is that it is constantly changing.
Requirements:
1. 500-600 words
2. At least 3 quotes from articles you have read for this class
3. Properly (MLA) cite your sources
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3T8xXqtrVqdCnpzvC2A2xIBtUm9B-qtWZ0SYpReRrA/edit?usp=drivesdk
Seattle has an interconnected network of transportation. The roads are adjacent to bike lanes, which are adjacent to sidewalks. These three corridors route traffic from people, cars, and bikes. The different transportation methods are densely packed into the city of Seattle, and it is important to understand how they work together, and how safety is maintained across all methods of travel.
	Cars make up the largest group of transportation. In fact, according to a Seattle Times article written in February of 2021 by Gene Balk, for every ten Seattle residents, there are about six cars (Balk). Seattle has the second highest car-to-resident ratio of cities in the United States, followed only by Long Beach in California (Balk). This number, however, is an average, obscuring the extra information about car-to-resident density that varies upon location. Seattle is a very diverse environment in many ways, and that is also true about the car-to-human density factor. Rich neighborhoods, such as Arroyo Heights in West Seattle, have car densities of over nine cars per ten people. But in more dense neighborhoods, such as the Chinatown-International district, there are only a little over two cars per ten people. This ratio is about the same as New York (Balk).
	The density of the neighborhood not only determines the number of cars that are ownedand therefore usedby its residents, but also the type of traffic flow that can be observed there. For example, in certain neighborhoods that are adjacent to major roads, having freeway-like speed limits next to residential neighborhoods can pose a threat to pedestrian safety. A Seattle Times article, written by Michelle Baruchman, describes the incongruity between high traffic fatalities and low commuter count in certain neighborhoods. The article notes several dangerous roads that have had problems with accidents and fatalities in Seattle. The most dangerous streets in Seattle, such as Lake City Way and Aurora Avenue North, have [speed limits greater than twenty-five miles-per-hour]. [...] Traffic safety is a longtime concern along Rainier Avenue South (Baruchman). One tactic that the Seattle Department of Transportation uses in order to make roads safer is to reduce the speed limit. However, an issue with these specific roads is that they are owned by Washington State, and not the city, making speed limit legislation a more difficult process.
Despite the roads that are out of Seattles hands, the city has tried to implement more traffic controls with the project Vision Zero. This policy includes the addition of crosswalk lines and crossing signage to increase pedestrian safety. However, according to author Baruchman, Seattle is not making significant progress toward reaching Vision Zero, its stated goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2030 (Baruchman). The Vision Zero policy, which was adopted in 2000, aims to ensure that pedestrians can safely join the dense environment of transport in Seattle. Allison Schwartz, Vision Zero coordinator for Seattles Department of Transportation, said, For decades, streets have been designed for the fast and free movement of vehicles rather than for the safety and comfort for human beings (Baruchman). Seattle is shifting its attention from the efficiency of carssingle-occupant job commuters in cars to focusing on helping pedestrians feel safe and able to use the transportation network. Of the 465 miles of arterial streets in Seattle, 335[, or just over seventy-two percent,] are now marked for 25 mph or slower (Baruchman). This restriction will reduce the fatality of traffic accidents.
However, one interesting note about the speed limits in Seattle, from a local-cultural perspective is that many people dont follow the limits. During assembly at DTS, when the winter formal dance was announced, the dress-code requirements were described as being as loose as the seattle twenty-five mile-per-hour speed limit, which elicited laughter from, presumably, the driving population of DTS. This shows that, in the publics eyeespecially the eye of young drivers that are fresh out of driving schoolspeeding isnt considered bad behavior, even if its against the law. So, while the city is trying to focus its attention on pedestrian safety, the local population doesnt see speeding as enough of an issue in order to obey the posted signs.
Roads are not the only transit path where safety is a concern. It is also important that sidewalks are maintained to ensure safety. Sidewalks can be damaged by flooding and tree roots. These are two main issues in addition to others. Both flooding and roots crack the sidewalk and make uneven surfaces, which need to be repaired. These uneven surfaces might not be problematic for DTS high schoolers, but more vulnerable populations such as the elderly who might use canes and walkers require smooth sidewalks in order to locomote. When it comes to repairs, if city owned entities cause sidewalk damage, the city will take responsibility for the repairs (Sidewalk Repair Program). Otherwise, it is the responsibility of property owners to ensure the safety and usability of their adjacent sidewalks. Seattle Municipal Code requires that adjacent property owners keep their sidewalks in good repair and safe for public travel. This means keeping the sidewalk clear from vegetation overgrowth, snow, and ice accumulation, as well as making repairs to the sidewalks when damaged (Sidewalk Repair Program). This responsibility cannot be shirked, and shows that homeownership in Seattle not only provides independence, but also requires responsibility.
In addition to prioritizing safety of humans, Seattle also values the safety of a precious resource on Earth, trees. When it comes to repairing sidewalks damaged by tree roots, the Seattle legislature says, Prior to pruning tree roots you must arrange for an SDOT [Seattle Department of Transportation] Arborist to evaluate how the pruning will impact the tree's health and public safety. This commitment to trees shows Seattles commitment to safety in the short term for the trees, and also in the long term, for having healthy air to breathe.
	Cars and pedestrians tend to stay in their respective lanes of transport, streets and sidewalks. However, one entity that blurs the lines between these two lanes are bikes. Bikes use both the street and the sidewalk, even if they bikes arent ridden in the latter location. The many parties that use the sidewalk curb include but are not limited to ride-share cars, bikes, scooters, and delivery trucks (Bliss and Small). One major investment that Seattle is making moving forward in the future is gathering data on parking of cars and e-bikes and e-scooters. Gathering data on where bikes are being used will help the city manage roadside parking spaces and bike lines in the most densely compounded zones. As transportation resetacher Regina Clewlow, co-founder and CEO of Populus, was quoted in a Bloomberg news article by Laura Bliss and Andrew Small, The interaction of many new alternatives impact people's travel choices. [...] Theres going to be a need for more data and information so cities can be more nimble in their policy and pricing. (Bliss and Small). Electric scooters and bikes are a fairly recent addition to Seattle's transportation network, and it will be important to ensure these electric vehicle riders, who, oftentimes, don't even wear helmets.
	Seattle is a city that has diverse methods of transportation, not all of which were mentioned in this response. These transportation tools are all used in the small confines of a busy city, and it's paramount that people are safe, despite desires to be as efficient as possible that are brought on by Seattle's constant development and influx of people.

Seattle has an interconnected network of transportation. The roads are adjacent to bike lanes, which are adjacent to sidewalks. These three corridors route traffic from people, cars, and bikes. The different transportation methods are densely packed into the city of Seattle, and it is important to understand how they work together, and how safety is maintained across all methods of travel.
	Cars make up the largest group of transportation. In fact, according to a Seattle Times article written in February of 2021 by Gene Balk, for every ten Seattle residents, there are about six cars (Balk). Seattle has the second highest car-to-resident ratio of cities in the United States, followed only by Long Beach in California (Balk). This number, however, is an average, obscuring the extra information about car-to-resident density that varies upon location. Seattle is a very diverse environment in many ways, and that is also true about the car-to-human density factor. Rich neighborhoods, such as Arroyo Heights in West Seattle, have car densities of over nine cars per ten people. But in more dense neighborhoods, such as the Chinatown-International district, there are only a little over two cars per ten people. This ratio is about the same as New York (Balk).

Journalism Should Be Completely Unregulated
Journalism is the practice of informing people about events in a manner that is as accurate to the facts, and as close to being unbiased as possible. However, these ethical requirements are difficult to maintain, especially since everyone with internet access can be a journalist. In the words of Aidan White, the director of Ethical Journalism Network, many more people today, [who] may not be journalists, commit acts of journalism (What is Journalism And Who Is A Journalist). In fact, in 2020 alone, there were over thirty-one million active bloggers. (How Many Blogs Are There?). Compounded by the fact that regulations on journalism ethics would be hard to implement for every blogger on the internet, journalism would benefit from zero regulation for two reasons. First, every journalist brings their own perspective to an issue; and second, the global audience can extract quality articles of journalism based upon the attention they give, and by cross-referencing the facts that articles contain.
One key reason why journalism should not be regulated is because each journalist has their own truth. As clarified by Lee Gutkind in his narrative nonfiction guidebook, You Can't Make This Stuff Up: The Complete Guide to Writing Creative Nonfiction -- from Memoir to Literary Journalism and Everything in Between, there is a difference between truth and facts, Truth is personal--it is filtered through our own lens and orientation. [...] Facts cannot be changed by perception. Description and detail can be confirmed (Gutkind 19, 20). Each journalist brings their own understanding and perspective to a story. Journalists can, even with the same facts, use different reasoning to support their own ideas on a topic. So the benefit of a massive diversity of bloggers around the world, is an equivalent diversity of ideas. Such diversity of ideas is important for understanding an issue; for example, even though The New York Times provides good articles, we cant read those articles without reading through the lens of a New York Times columnist.
Interaction with content on the internet often comes in the form of a snowball effect of attention. One person will read an article, and then share it. In fact, a term for popular content on the internet is, viral, suggesting that said content has spread from person to person like a virus. It is for this reason that the consumers of journalism, the global audience of the internet, can easily control what sources of journalism--or what articles of journalism, because sometimes journalists might write good and bad articles--based on how much they interact with the content. A good article will be shared, but a boring article will not be.
However, there is a downside to articles gaining attention by internet shares. Exaggerated, timely, and provocative content, which is often exaggerated for that very purpose of provocation, will take precedence over well-researched, thoroughly edited, and fact-reliant articles. Such articles could even be examples of conspiracy theories. But, a solution to this problem evolves from the system of the global audience. Primarily, a journalist who publishes too quickly without fact-checking, and writes too provocatively without regard for the truth, will lose credibility in the minds of the global audience. If a journalist loses their reputation, then the global audience will not interact with their content as much in the future. If you make stuff up, you very likely will get caught and there will be consequences. (Gutkind 14). And, secondarily, journalists that make up their own facts--this argument focuses on the individual journalist, as opposed to a journalists article, because if a journalist makes up facts in one article, that transgression against journalistic ethics likely translates onto other articles.--cannot prove their lies when truth is more abundant. For example, if bloggers were to include some facts and some lies, and readers are smart enough to read multiple articles, the global audience would be able to cross-check the facts, and come to a conclusion that both included all the journalist's perspectives, but also, all the facts. Despite this, its good practice, as written in The Truth Matters, as a consumer of journalism, to be skeptical whenever someone doesnt appear to be affiliated with a reputable institution or lacks reasonable experience. (Bartlett 47).
The main takeaway from the concept of unregulated journalism is that it only works if the global audience, the readers, are active comprehenders of journalistic ethics, working on their own to determine the facts, but also to empathize with the different personal truths and perspectives of journalists. So, in an ideal situation, where the global audience is responsible for their own understanding of all the journalistic articles, then journalism needs no regulations. However, people dont have enough time to do all that checking themselves; thats why journalism is a profession. From the expert, as Aidan White said, Although the door is open to far more people being engaged in journalism, it does not dilute the importance of standards and quality in the work thats being done. (What is Journalism And Who Is A Journalist).

?Writing Prompt: Seattle - Design and Intention
Luca Millard-Kish
	Seattle is a city of contradictions. We are one of the most technologically advanced cities, a hub for Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and more, yet we still face the challenges of any city. In an article by Jon Talton, he refers to 3rd Avenue as Seattles Endangered Lifeblood where public safety is especially failing. (Talton) This street, at the same time, is a transit corridor for all of the tech workers coming in and out of the city. 3rd Avenue, in a flourishing and developed city, is also one of the most crime-ridden stretches in Seattle. This is just one example of where Seattle has had an opportunity for meaningful change and has yet to address it.
Another example of this lack of action that is quite close to my heart is art. Seattle prides itself on its art and culture, yet programs dedicated to art and individuals striving to make the world a more beautiful place lack the funding they require. In Seattle and beyond, art is appreciated but rarely truly valued. Its seen in our world as a glorified hobby, yet in times of great suffering (the COVID 19 pandemic), its turned to in order to instill hope and inspiration. In 2019, when the viaduct by the waterfront was demolished for safety purposes, there was a plan to create a waterfront park that would also act as a summer home for the Seattle Symphony. While the park may still become a reality, the summer home for the Symphony was ruled out for budget reasons. However, as written in the Seattle Times in 2021, Washington will see nearly $8.6 billion in dedicated funds towards infrastructure projects (Roberts). This hardly seems like a budget issue. This is a systemic issue of values. Seattle is home to some of the most dynamic arts communities, yet the city doesnt see this development as essential to human life. 
My proposal for a change in Seattle is to follow through with the initial idea of a waterfront park with an outdoor performance space. As shown above, our city budget (collected from taxes), offers more than enough resources to make this dream a reality. This outdoor park and gathering space would encourage Seattlites to be active in their community, enjoy the beauty of the Pacific Northwest waterfront, and de-stress from the intense standards, requirements, and expectations of a thriving urban hub. All the while, money funneled into this tourist attraction would be recycled back into the arts. This is a positive cycle where earnings from the arts go back to fuel the arts. Studies show that the impact of the arts on mental health is enormous. Research states that The performing arts get people out from behind their screens and [put] them into a positive social setting, where they can build important social skills. Face to face interaction also promotes belonging and community. (Reset Brain + Body | Integrative Mental Health Counseling) Especially in a time of quarantine and isolation, the arts are crucial to our wellbeing. This outdoor (COVID-safe) space would allow for us to have a place to go and reset as a society.
As I said in the beginning, Seattle is a city of contradictions. We have the capacity to bring about this positive change but have chosen to allocate funds elsewhere. In the coming years, the decisions around this waterfront land will speak volumes about what we value as a society and where still have room to grow.

Local Boy Saved from the Heroic Actions of an Old Man
During the hottest summer day of 1989, an old Puerto Rican man was walking down the street with his cart of Helado de Coco shaved ice. As he slowly pushes his cart with a block of ice and many colorful ice flavors, kids from all around the block sprint into the street to buy a tasty way to cool themselves off during a hot summer day. As the Puerto Rican man starts handing out shaved ice to the young kids around, the familiar sound of the Mr. Softee truck begins to approach. As the ice-cream truck pulls over to the curb, Eddie, a local boy from the neighborhood, runs away from the shaved ice cart toward the truck with excitement yelling Ice Cream!. Meanwhile, a speeding car approaches from behind. Da Mayor, a local man who was watching the incident, sees the speeding car bearing on Eddie and rushes across the street to save him. Just in time, Da Mayor dives to push Eddie out of the path of the car, resulting in both being knocked to the ground. Eddie, who was scared to death after the incident, begins to cry as Da Mayor helps him get up. As Eddies mother approaches the scene, Eddie tells his mother that Da Mayor had knocked him down, but after Da Mayor explains what really happened, Eddie stays silent with shame as it becomes clear that he didnt tell the truth to his mother. After Eddies mother thanks Da Mayor for saving his son, she and Eddie return to their house. Thanks to Da Mayors heroic efforts, the life of a young boy was saved. Da Mayor later mentioned I wasn't trying to be a hero. I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think. If I did, I might not have done it in second thought. Da Mayor, an old man, haven't run that fast in years. His actions were recognized throughout the town as an act of heroism. Even Mother Sister, a local older woman who did not approve of Da Mayor, later told him how brave he was.?Sarah Epelbaum

Role of the North Korean President
		Most people would agree that there is little to no connection between first world countries and North Korea. This mysterious country, stuck between South Korea and China, is home to one of the most brutal cases of dictatorship of our era. While we are complaining about internet addictions and fake news, North Koreans must live in constant fear of arrest for even the slightest of errors. From an outside perspective, one must wonder how the leaders of such a regime have maintained control over the country for so long. Various religions have existed for thousands of years and are still heavily practiced despite advancements in technology and other forms of ethics. In fact, the first president of North Korea designed his image to fit that of an omnipotent god for this exact reason. The role of Kim Jung Un as a religious figure in North Korea can be understood through North Koreas view on major religions and the use of Juche ideology as a political tool for control. 
Although its not prohibited in the constitution, North Korea will brutally punish anyone who is suspected of practicing religion without their approval. A study on North Korea from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom shows just how terrible the conditions are. According to them, Religious freedom conditions in North Korea are among the worst in the world despite religious freedom being explicitly stated in their constitution. It nominally grants freedom of religious belief, but it draws the line if this causes drawing in foreign forces or for harming the State, which could be interpreted differently depending on the context. The punishment for this ambiguous crime includes arrest, torture, imprisonment, and execution making it one of the most dangerous places to practice religion. Although North Korean citizens are essentially prohibited from practicing religion, the country has a core belief system similar to major religions of the world. 
	The North Korean government encourages atheism as part of the communist ideology and has the Juche doctrine as their core belief system. An article from World Atlas wrote this about North Koreas belief system, The country promotes state-sponsored atheism, since it is communist and has a national doctrine of Juche that says people should break from being dependent on spiritual ideas (Sawe). In a study on the philosophy of Juche, they found that Kim Il-Sung explained Juche as being the master of revolution and reconstruction in ones own country, and essentially giving power to the collective group of individuals (Lee). In practice, this means rejecting dependence on others, using ones own brains, believing in ones own strength (Lee). But over the years, Juche has evolved into more of a spiritual belief system, rather just an economic one. A study of juche ideology states, The North Koreans were made to worship Kim with Juche as the political philosophy of a ruling government. However, it was transformed into religion because the people believed that the ruler (Kim Il Sung) is not elected; instead, he is a supreme human (Widjaja). Much like major religions, the Juche belief system has god-like leaders and clearly established rules to translate a philosophy on life into its practical application.  
Both Juche ideology and the belief system of abrahamic religions are used as a means of control. According to a study, The North Koreans were made to worship Kim with Juche as the political philosophy of a ruling government (Widaja). But, this was not always the case. The article later claims that, it was transformed into religion because the people believed that the ruler (Kim Il Sung) is not elected; instead, he is a supreme human (Widjaja). At first, Kim Il-Sung actually opposed religion because he believed it to be superstitious to have faith in a god. Eventually, he transformed Juche into basically a religious belief system with him as a supreme person, similar to jesus. 
Another similarity between Juche ideology and abrahamic religions is using the religion as a political tool. In the same study the author later explains, Therefore, the theory that religion can be used as a political tool or politically using religion is correct, as is North Korea's case. Juche did not offer salvation such as religion in general, but Juche found it a political tool of totalitarianism. The indoctrination that has taken place in North Korea through the instrument of Juche ideology and it is a barrier that undermines the introduction of other ideologies and religion (Widaja). The juche ideology is used as a barrier that shields the people from exploring other belief systems, which is similar to how most religions operate. Since there is only one religion in North Korea, the president is able to use it as a political tool of totalitarianism. 
The establishment of major religions set a precedent for North Korean dictators, specifically in the relationship between god and his followers. The mystery behind North Koreas strict regime can be understood under this familiar framework, there by connecting our experiences to North Koreans, at least partially. Its important to remember that the people living in this isolated country are just as complex and important as anyone else, despite living under a cruel dictatorship and physically separated from the rest of the world.

The researcher in a book titled World Affairs uses the history of North Korea to analyse the ritual of mourning the death of the president. The purpose of this article is comparing and contrasting the mourning ritual in North Korea to other countries and highlighting the unique aspects of their ritual. Despite being written in the year 2000, this article is very relevant to my paper due to its emphasis on how the average North Korean views the president, as well as the role of the president.

This study aims to determine the reason behind establishing Juche ideology in North Korea and its transformation into a religion despite the influence of communism. This article is the most relevant to my paper compared to the other other articles because it focuses on Juche ideology which is my second subtopic. It is also the most relevant and recent as it was written in 2021 after the death of the last president. This source first dives into the influence of communism and confucianism in North Korea, as well as the view on other major religions. Later, it explains the motive behind establishing Juche as a religion, specifically its use as a means to control the population. This article was intended for a broad audience as it is easy to understand and avoids excessive jargon. It is less dense than the previous article and more useful for my paper.

This article, written in the International Bulletin of Missionary Research, focuses on the background and context of the regime through the philosophy of Juche. This article is coming from a slightly biased perspective, as it is written through the Christian perspective as opposed to an atheist perspective. Despite this, the study is very dense and covers a variety of topics related to the use of Juche as a tool in the regime. This article was intended for other researchers to use because it is published for a research foundation and is quite dense. For the average person, this study would be too long and possibly hard to follow. It is also slightly outdated, written in 2008, but the historical background section is highly cited and well researched. In contrast to the other sources, this one is much longer and it was much harder to find relevant quotes which werent too long. 
?Although there are multiple war on conflicts, most famously War on Terror and War on Drugs, there are many similarities between all of them despite focusing on completely different issues. What makes these war on conflicts different from normal wars is that normal wars usually have clear opposing sides in the same conflict. On the contrary, war on conflicts cant be clearly defined and the lines between enemy and ally are blurred. Theres a reason why these wars dont contain the name of a specific country such as the Mexican-American war or the Vietnam war. Instead of fighting a distinct group, the enemy is nebulous, its everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The terror in War on Terror cannot be measured, and there are no defined terms at which this war will be over. In fact, the more the media focuses on the terror aspect, the more terrified the people will be. This is essential for understanding the nature of these conflicts. 
	Essentially, the war on conflicts are all about framing. In the War on Terror, instead of focusing on the livelihood of citizens directly affected by the conflict, its about fighting the terror resulting from the conflict. One of the main turning points in the War on Terror is 9/11, prompting the invasion of Afghanistan and resulted in nearly 2 decades of war. By focusing on the conflict from the US perspective, the government was able to justify their involvement up until this point. A minority of Afghans support the USs actions in their country, as they have consistently disrespected their culture and religion. Much like the War on Terror, the War on Journalism in Russia frames the issue of censorship and propaganda through journalism. The problem doesnt lie in journalism in itself, but the effects of information being spread throughout the population. The news in Russia is often inaccurate and misleading for the purpose of keeping Putin in power. Therefore both wars are framed to distract from the main problem by focusing on a consequence of the issue. 
Another similarity between the war on conflicts is that there is often no clear start and end to the war. In class, we discussed multiple potential starting points of the war on terror, and the farther back we went the more complicated it was to figure out the start. Since nothing in history exists in a vacuum, all major events were likely catalyzed by a previous event and built off of each other. In the war on journalism, I had to research as far back as the 1800s, and in the case of China this issue was present over 1000 years ago. Compared to conflicts between countries, the war on wars cannot be traced back to a single event and most dont have a clear end. The US will continue to fight the terror, creating more terror from within.?Fight in NYC neighborhood turns violent; young man murdered by police officer
Last night on the hottest day of the summer, an altercation at Sals Pizzeria turned deadly, resulting in a fire and the death of a young man called Radio Raheem. 
At the popular Italian-American family-owned pizza joint in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a predominantly black neighborhood in Brooklyn, there was a fight between the owner of the pizza place and two young men from the neighborhood that quickly turned into a large-scale tussle involving law enforcement officers and many civilians. What happened that night that ended in a fire that destroyed the entire restaurant and the death of a young man?
 According to witnesses, tensions had already been rising between Buggin Out, a young man from the neighborhood, and Sal, the owner of Sals Pizzeria. A few days earlier, Buggin Out had been publicly kicked out of the restaurant after demanding that Sal, put some brothers up on this wall of fame, a wall in the pizza parlor that only held pictures of Italian Americans (pg. 15). After he was forced out, Buggin Out started yelling, Boycott Sals. Boycott Sals, and began asking others in the neighborhood if they would stand in solidarity and boycott Sals Pizzeria with him (pg. 15).
The night of the incident, right as the restaurant was closing, Radio Raheem and Buggin Out entered the restaurant. Radio Raheem was carrying a radio box that was playing rap music very loudly while Buggin Out demanded of Sal again, we want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame (pg. 77). After Sal again refused to add black people to the Wall of Fame and Radio Raheem refused to turn his music down, a fight broke out after Sal smashed Radio Raheems radio box with a baseball bat. After the fight spilled onto the street, members of the community began to gather, finally storming the pizza place after a chair was thrown through a window by Mookie, a delivery boy for Sals Pizzeria, and eventually setting fire to it. After firefighters and law enforcement arrived, the civilians began to turn on the firefighters and police officers who had come to fight the fire and disperse the crowd. 
After Radio Raheem wouldnt comply with a police officers demands and be taken away peacefully, the police officer strangled Radio Raheem to death in front of the crowd. His body was carried away with the help of other officers and dumped in a police car to be taken away. Additionally, when the mob refused to leave, the firefighters and police officers turned on the civilians, hitting them with batons, handcuffing them, and even turning the fire hoses on them. 
Overall, the night was filled with chaos and the unfortunate death of a young black man, only one incident among many violent racially charged incidents in New York City this summer. Moving forward, hopefully, fewer incidents like the one last night will occur, and both law enforcement and civilians will remember to stay civil in future clashes to avoid any more untimely deaths and destruction of property.

QUESTION PRESENTED
Amicus is Zo Predmore, President of the United States of America. As leader of the country, she wishes to protect and reinforce the rights of the people of the United States bestowed to all citizens in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments. Amicus seeks a ruling from this Court that allows for these liberties to be granted to each citizen, regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. 
ii
FACTS OF THE CASE
Though the Civil Rights Act of 1875 granted equality of all men before the law and all people access to public spaces such as theaters, transportation, and hotels, five separate cases of black people being denied access to these areas were reported. The Court is to examine whether or not the Civil Rights Act of 1875 violated the rights of citizens to conduct business as they please in privately owned businesses, as granted in the tenth amendment (The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people). 
 iii
ISSUES AT HAND 
When examining this case, one must not look simply at the tenth amendment, but also those succeeding it; the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments. 
iv
ARGUMENT
The tenth amendment is being used as an excuse to discriminate against people of color in a violation of the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments. The thirteenth amendment abolishes slavery from the United States, an act that, while not specifically mentioning race, was the means by which black people were freed from enslavement. On top of that, in the fourteenth amendment all people born or naturalized in the U.S were made citizens, and are granted the privileges and immunities thereof. The thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments work together to shape the image of true equality in this country. They grant, first, equality to all; no person shall serve another. Second, citizenship to all; each person in this country is equal in the eyes of the law, no matter their skin color. Third, they are granted representation, and the ability to vote for what they believe in. We mustnt see these as free-standing amendments, they are each connected and created to protect the newly given rights of black people in this country. Though they refer to all persons'' all white persons were already granted these rights before, and therefore these amendments should be interpreted as speaking specifically about the freedoms granted to people of color. The purpose of the thirteenth amendment, and likewise the fourteenth and fifteenth, was not simply to end slavery in the way that it was because it would simply resurface with a slightly new face. The amendments were meant to destroy the entire institution of racism. As Justice Harlen quoted in his dissent: It is not the words of the law, but the internal sense of it that makes the law; the letter of the law is the body; the sense and reason of the law is the soul. These amendments were written with the intent of creating all men equal, not so that discrimination would reform in new ways. With the reconstruction of our country we no longer stand for the inequalities faced by black people in this country. After the war, we became a new country, one that represents freedom - real freedom - as well as life, liberty, and property for all of our citizens. However, the issue at hand is not a tenth amendment issue, its a thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendment issue as it deals specifically with race. We are not seeing our white citizens similarly denied access to these accommodations. This is an issue specifically affecting black people, as an attempt to uphold the very system of racism we are trying to wipe from this country. Though privately owned businesses claim that they should be regulated as private individuals, these spaces are where people gather as a community. They are places where friends get together, where children play, where families connect. These spaces are unequivocally public spaces as it is where the public goes to come together. These places are as much a part of society as any public park one may gather in, and denying black people access is to treat them as if they are not accepted as people in that society. This is yet another means of alienation.  The Civil Rights act of 1875 does not violate the 10th amendment because these spaces are not to be counted as private associations as they are open to the public and operate in public places. 
The Court may claim they have no jurisdiction to see this case but this is false. The court adjudges, I think erroneously, that Congress is without power, under either the
Thirteenth or Fourteenth Amendment, to establish such regulations (Justice Harlens dissent). These laws are not foreign. This Court passed this very law and gave themselves the authority to reinforce the freedoms of each citizen, no matter their skin color. Yet, they now question their own power of jurisdiction. Did they, and in addition the states, not pass two amendments that stated The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation? This Court gave themselves power they are now too afraid to yield. Is this how we want to shape our country after reconstruction? As a society that grants certain establishments the right to deny a fellow citizen of their liberty simply because of the tone of their skin? Are we to completely disregard the amendments created to give all men freedom in this country? Does our Declaration of Independence not state that ...all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness? We did not go to war so that we may rebuild ourselves as a country blind to the inequalities of our black citizens. We fought for this freedom, and now we must use it to lift up all of our citizens to become a true nation of equality.

Introduction
A bronze likeness of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, famed revolutionary and leader of the movement that led to the founding of the Soviet Union, looms over N 36th Street, in the heart of Seattles Fremont neighborhood. At 16 feet, the statue has been the subject of conversation and controversy among the citys residents since its placement in 1995, when it was placed in trust by the Fremont Chamber. In any other city in the United States, such a statue would almost certainly be seen as an unacceptable display of sympathy and commemoration for Lenin, the Soviet Union, and communism as a whole. In Seattle, his past 30 years spent languishing in Fremont have transformed Lenin into a unique character of the neighborhood. Known for its eccentricity, Fremont has made Lenin a part of its annual festivities. During Christmas, youre likely to find colorful lights strung on the imposing figure. During pride month, you might find Lenin fully decked out in drag1. Lenin has, at times, even worn an occasional advertisement for the nearby Taco Del Mar2. Though the statue is not without controversy, for 30 years it has remained. For 30 years, as arguments over the place of Confederate statues have raged across the United States, Lenin remains constant in Seattle. Elsewhere in the United States, the statue is used as evidence of Seattle's unacceptable radicalism and disloyalty to the United States. Though such an extreme assertion may be without a logical basis, it is not ridiculous to wonder: what is it about Seattle that makes it a good home for the Lenin Statue? The statues plaque states that Lenins purpose is to serve as a reminder of an important historical period. The historical period the description refers to, presumably, are the 7 years in which Vladimir Ilyich Lenin founded and presided over the government of the Soviet Union. To remember a nations founding in this way is to also remember the nation itself. The monuments of Washington DC, for example, are a love letter to the United States and its founding principles. Though not quite such an affectionate ode, Seattles Lenin statue serves as a reminder of the now-defunct Soviet Union over its entire history. But its conspicuous location also serves as a reminder of a local, much lesser-known history: that of the city of Seattles complex relationship with the Soviet Union and radicalism at large. Though considerably obscure, the progression of this relationship, from 1917 to 2022, has deeply influenced the city of Seattle.

I.The Ringing of Revolution: Bolshevism, Idealism, and Americanism
In November of 1917, an economically and politically turbulent Russia ushered in a new age of governance. The February Revolution earlier that year brought the abdication of former Czar Nicholas II and with it the official end of Russias imperial government. Nicholas was succeeded by a provisional gubernatorial body, the Duma, intended to eventually assist in the transition to a new, more democratic Russian government. But the Duma was ill-prepared to deal with the rising tide of social unrest that would ultimately lead to its overthrow. In November, Russias leftist Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir Lenin, seized power. The global implications of the Bolshevik revolution were immediate. The United States and its allies in World War I, now bereft of one of their most important allies, were hesitant to embrace the newly formed Soviet government. American radicals, on the other hand, saw the revolution as a harbinger of the paradigm shift the global proletariat had been waiting on. Though brutal civil war raged through the Russian countryside until 1922, many leftists in the United States saw Moscow as a beacon of hope amid rising class tensions and economic turmoil at home.
The rapid industrialization of American production expanded the working class and created a need for unionization. The Industrial Workers of the World, or Wobblies, founded in Chicago in 1905, worked tirelessly toward the goal of One Big Union in the years leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1916, in hopes of achieving this lofty goal, Wobblie members from Seattle planned a demonstration North of the city, in the town of Everett. What resulted was a violent confrontation between the Wobblies and 200 citizen deputies, directed by the Snohomish Sheriff to meet the demonstrators as they arrived at Port Gardner Bay. Up to 12 IWW members were killed in what came to be known as the Everett Massacre. Such was the general climate of political radicalism in Washington in the years between 1900 and 1917. Unions were formed and political dissent was brewing, but resistance from businesses and the government was too strong for these radical efforts to amount to anything. One of the most prominent Washington radicals of the time was Anna Louise Strong, whose political career began in 1916 when she was elected to the Seattle School Board. As a member of the board, she was outspoken about her radical and sometimes unpopular views. For example, Strong was strongly opposed to
U.S involvement in World War I. It was Strongs advocacy for Louise Olivereau, a Wobblie typist involved in distributing anti-war propaganda and charged with sedition, that led the Seattle School Board to issue a recall against Strong3. Having blemished her political career in the United States, the Bolshevik Revolution came at an opportune time for Strong. For the first time, it seemed that a tangible manifestation of her political ideals was possible.
These sentiments were shared among radicals in Seattle and came to a head during the 1919 General Strike. The strike was the first American general strike and was demonstrative of increasing labor unrest succeeding the political excitement of the Bolshevik Revolution and the economic devastation of World War I. Anna Louise Strongs editorial in the Seattle paper Union Record, published two days before the strike on November 4, reads like an impassioned call for

revolutionary action. It was her claim that the labor movement of Seattle, the United States, and the world at large were headed down a path to, as her articles title suggests, NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!4. This unknowable place, as it turned out, was the United States First Red Scare. Unnerved by the rising labor unrest in the country demonstrated by the Seattle General Strike and the dangerous precedent set by the communist revolution in Russia, US politicians took a hard stance against communism. This period is most remembered for the Palmer Raids, a government-backed crusade against radicalism dedicated to discovering and arresting political insurgents. The First Red Scare also had local implications in Seattle, where, despite the relative failure of the General Strike, political tensions were still running high. In November of 1919, Washington State passed a law banning the IWW due to a violent clash instigated by a Veterans group against the Wobblies office in Centralia5.
Disheartened by the lack of progress being made in Seattle and the United States, many political radicals turned to another option. If revolution could not be brought to the United States, perhaps it was best to set out in search of the revolution. Many American radicals, including Anna Louise Strong, made their way to Russia, hoping to be at the center of the actualization of their ideology. Though some were critical of liberties taken by the new Soviet government that favored the maintenance of power over ideological purity, many American radicals saw Russia as a viable option for a better life, one that was not only more in line with their ideological beliefs, but also, somewhat ironically, yielded more material success. Anna Louise Strong moved to Russia as a foreign correspondent and would become one of the most prolific leftwing journalists of her time. She continued her support for Soviet Russia throughout the rest of her life and later lived and worked in communist China6. For Strong, the Bolshevik Revolution opened a door for a career and life that both aligned with her own radical beliefs and was materially beneficial.
It was this same goal that led several groups of Americans to make the trek to Soviet Russia with the intention of creating and working on agrarian communes. Due to mass immigration and political disorganization, the Soviet government was in need of labor and saw the establishment of communes as an opportunity to import a foreign workforce and sow the seeds for what they saw as the end goal of collectivized agriculture. Certain Americans, sympathetic to the Soviet cause, were more than happy to make the sacrifice. The Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, an American organization that sought to provide political and monetary support to the Soviets, was highly involved in the organization of the communes and in the facilitation of communication between commune members and the Russian government. In 1921, a group of Finnish-American immigrants from Washington met in Kirkland to discuss their plans for a commune in Russia. After deliberation, it was decided that the commune would be called Seattle, for the states largest city and the center of radical politics in Washington. After

gaining approval from the Soviet government, the Seattle commune members worked to pool funds for farming materials. It was in part due to this substantial capital that the commune was able to prosper. Despite conflicts due to national differences and difficulty assimilating into life among the locals of the Russian countryside, the Seattle commune, located deep in the North Caucasian Steppe, was a moderate success compared to the relative failure of other similar American communes. Seattle operated as a commune until 1940 when it was ultimately dissolved. Today, the village of Seiatel, located at the former site of the commune, is all that remains of the political experiment7.
Many of the original commune members were politically involved, particularly in fishing unions and cooperatives, which was common among Washingtons large Finnish population at the time. Some men, including Victor Saulit, were more directly involved in socialist politics. Saulit, the communes third chairman, was an active member of the socialist and later communist parties of the United States. His dedication to the latter was demonstrated by his participation in the founding of the party, an offset of the Emergency Convention of the Socialist Party of America, which was occurring simultaneously. Saulit endured persecution for his beliefs as one of 10,000 arrested during the Palmer Raids8. Saulits ideological dedication lead to his prominent role in the Seattle Commune, as was true for many of its members. Of course, the economic devastation of World War I also served as a primary propellant force for the communes founding members toward a new life in Russia. This economic dissatisfaction made up a large portion of the general attitude of American radicals during this period. Where they once saw an opportunity to bring socialism to the United States through the organization of workers, many, though not all, now saw a dismal wasteland destroyed beyond repair by industrial capitalism. Victor Saulit, on trial in Portland, said of America: No man in this country receives the full product of his toil if he is working for somebody else. Another commune member, Ukrainian Trofim Malich, described his motivation for moving to Russia: America is hell. At every step the working man sees with despair the luxuries of the rich while his brothers moan from unemployment and poverty9. The idealization of Soviet Russia, then, came from a deep dissatisfaction with the American economic, social, and political climate.

II.New Frontiers: The Red Scare and Cold War
The Great Depression of the 1930s brought with it a new red wave in Washington state. In the wake of severe economic depression sweeping the state, many turned to the newly formed communist party, which experienced a period of unprecedented growth during this time. James Farley Postmaster General under the Roosevelt administration is quoted as claiming there are forty-seven states in the Union, and the Soviet of Washington10. The comment, though facetious, illustrates the national perception of Washington state at the time. Seattle especially was seen as a hotbed for radical politics. The communist party was able to amass power in Washington partly through the use of so-called communist fronts, organizations that, although they were not officially affiliated with the party, were mainly led by communists. Two of the most influential of these organizations were the Washington Commonwealth Federation, or WCF, and the Washington Pension Union, or WPU, through which the CP was able to elect members to the Washington State legislature on the democratic ticket. Because Russia now promoted a United Front philosophy, the American CP proclaimed its support for the socialist reforms brought by Roosevelts New Deal. This shift in the party created more opportunities for collaboration between democrats and communists. Support for the communists waned, however, when policy changes were made in accordance with Joseph Stalins 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact.
However, the Nazi invasion of the USSR led to a reversal of this policy and a full embrace of the war effort by the American CP, against their ideological persuasions11.
It was not until after the Second World War that souring relations between the US and USSR would bring forth the nation's Second Red Scare. World War II depleted the global economy and left behind two superpowers in the United States and the Soviet Union. Relations between the two quickly took a turn for the worst as the Soviets established satellite governments in Eastern Europe. Freshly scarred from World War II, the Truman Administration saw these actions as fascist expansionism under Stalin. The 1947 Truman Doctrine, which vilified communism and exalted capitalism, established an indirect containment policy for Soviet expansion by supplying military and monetary aid to countries under threat of communism. With it began the Cold War, a period of heightened tension between the two global superpowers that would last until 1991. The Cold Wars impact on Washington State and Seattle was twofold.
Washingtons economy is and was deeply tied to military spending: when military spending was increased rapidly and dramatically to mitigate the threat of war with the Soviets, Washington benefited profusely. Over one million people moved to Washington during the Cold Wars
pre-dtente phase, from 1947 to 1970. The extensive navy base in Bremerton and air station on Whidby Island were funded and expanded primarily during the Cold War years, and the military presence in Washington today has been profoundly shaped by the Cold War. To secure more funding for military spending in Washington, state lawmakers Henry Jackson and Warren G. Magnuson exaggerated their anti-communist views to gain the favor of the federal government.

In fact, following Sputnik, Magnuson was instrumental in the acquisition of the $10 million from Congress used to put on the 1962 Seattle Worlds Fair, a demonstration of the technological prowess of the United States in the face of Soviet advancement. Seattles landmark Space Needle still looms tall over the city; a testament to the Cold Wars enduring legacy on Washingtons infrastructure.
Perhaps less easily identified are the cultural, social, and political impacts that underpin the physical evidence of the Cold War. Anti-communist sentiments in Washington State not only shaped the Bremerton Navy Base and Seattle Space Needle, but also paved the way for the unjust persecution of accused communists during the Second Red Scare. By 1946, state republicans had refocused their partys aims to center on the extermination of communism and held a majority for the first time since 1930. One of these newly elected republicans, Albert Canwell, was particularly concerned with the rise of communist insurgency, which he claimed was an existential threat to the sanctity of the American government and way of life. Canwell was the primary proponent of the 1947 resolution which led to the establishment of the Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. Canwell, the chairman of the newly-founded committee, dictated that the hearings should only permit the testimony of committee members and approved witnesses. The accused were not provided with an adequate defense nor were they granted the right to cross-examine. In 1948, the Canwell Committee launched an investigation into what they suspected was subversive communist activity at the University of Washington. The universitys Tenure Committee was ultimately left to determine the fate of the six employees who admitted to being party members at some point, only one of whom they voted to terminate. The most contentious of these decisions were those concerning Herbert Phillips and Joseph Buttersworth, who remained active party members at the time of the hearings. This controversy sparked a debate about the level of intellectual autonomy that communists possessed. Committee members wondered whether it was possible to deliver an unbiased education when ones political loyalties lay with a foreign government. The committee considered employment by the university and loyalty to the communist party to be in conflict with one another. UWs position was spelled out in an official statement issued by the Tenure Committee:
These respondents seek and assert the right to remain in the employ of a state which they hope to destroy and, as members of a minority group, seek and assert a right to protection when their own political faith denies any such right to any other minority once Communism becomes dominant. Only the magnanimity of a most benevolent government can be invoked to honor these requests.12
Despite their condemnation of the political affiliations of Phillips and Buttersworth, the Tenure Committee ruled not to fire them, as there was nothing in the tenure code that gave the committee the jurisdiction to do so. This decision was later overruled by the UW Regents, under the direction of UW President Raymond Allen. This decision set a dangerous precedent for
12 Report of the Tenure Committee and Recommendations of UW President Raymond Allen
intellectual persecution in the United States during the early years of the Cold War. Phillips and Buttersworth are two of many professors who would lose their jobs during the Cold War. And though the Canwell Committee was dissolved in 1948, it served as an example for similar
anti-communist state committees across the country.
As anti-communist paranoia began its upward climb in Washington State, the once profound influence of the WPU and other communist front organizations began to waver. In 1948, the WPU pushed for the passing of Initiative 172: a measure that would expand the social safety net for low-income Washingtonians and instate a basic income for the elderly. Despite its success in the elections of 1948, the initiative did not meet its aims. Because the proposal itself indicated no source of funding and the state legislature refused to raise taxes, the additional social security spending, alongside other factors, left no room in the budget and created a deficit within the first year of its implementation. Governer Arther Langlie blamed the fiscal crisis on Initiative 172 and the WPU, claiming the measure was a communist plot to bankrupt our state.13 The WPU was able to sustain itself and continue its support for 172 well enough until 1950, when Langlies antagonism ultimately won out. The WPUs loss of power, and subsequently the delegitimization of communist and socialist politicians in Washington, came as a result of Trumans 1950 Korean War, which the WPU condemned as an imperialist endeavor based on foolish ambitions of containment by proxy. This position, in line with that of the Soviets, was what allowed Langlie to effectively nullify the WPU healthcare initiative and prevent the socialist reforms they hoped to achieve in the future. As the WPU was relegated to obscurity by absolutist Red Scare rhetoric, so too were the benefits their influence may have had.
In some sense, Washington state was an early adopter of the Second Red Scare.
Throughout the early 1950s, wherein renowned senator Joseph McCarthy and the national Red Scare gripped the nation tightly, staunch anti-communist and anti-Soviet policies continued to deplete political radicalism and First Amendment rights throughout Washington. But Washington was also early to reject the Red Scare. By the mid-1950s, the people of Seattle, especially at the UW campus, had become embittered by excessive McCarthyist policies eating away at intellectual liberty. This shift in opinion led to a dispute regarding the universitys loyalty oaths, which forced employees to disavow allegiance to any group unaligned with the values of the institution and the United States; most importantly the communist party. The Supreme Courts 1964 Baggett v. Bullit decision declared UWs loyalty oaths unconstitutional, a huge step away from the deterministic logic that controlled American courts in the 1950s14. Washingtons central role in both the development and relaxation of Cold War policies is a testament to the places profoundly complex and intimate relationship with communism and the Soviet Union. The background of radical politics and Soviet sympathies in Seattle made it especially vulnerable to rapid and unfair policy changes that targeted freedom of thought. At the same time, it was this culture of dissent that began to break down the restrictions of the Second Red Scare.

III.Modern Manifestations: Trash Can Park and the Third Red Scare
After the relaxation of Cold War tensions under the Nixon administration, radical politics and Soviet influence in Seattle entered a period of flux in which it would remain for the next 20 years. Though Seattle was still seen as a radically progressive city, the Cold War virtually diminished all the power Washingtons Communist Party had amassed between 1917 and 1948. Long gone were the Wobblies dreams of One Big Union, and Seattles radicals separated into separate factions. Though the 1960s and 1970s saw some very significant protest movements in Seattle, they were thoroughly removed from the Soviet influence once characteristic of Seattle radicalism. The initial idealism that followed the Bolshevik Revolution, then replaced by Red Scare paranoia, had now faded into relative inconsequence. Though the Soviet Union no longer had any real stake in Seattle, remnants of the connection between the two continued to influence Seattle. In 1973, a sister city association was established between Seattle and Tashkent, Uzbekistan: the first such relationship between a US and Soviet city. The association was formed out of a friendship and academic partnership between the University of Washington and academics in Tashkent that began in the early 1960s. The relationship between the cities remained strong, even in the face of strained relations between the US and USSR between 1975 and 1985. In 1979, in light of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the boycott of the 1980 Olympics, Seattle vowed, somewhat controversially, to maintain the sister-city relationship. The Seattle-Tashkent Sister City Association was steadfast in its commitment to friendly US-Soviet relationships throughout the 1980s. A 1985 visit of a large delegation from Tashkent to Seattle sent shockwaves through the city and opened the door for a closer relationship between the cities. Seattle became a model for other US-USSR sister cities, emblematic of the desire for peace and communication between the two nations15.
In 1974, a park was dedicated to Tashkent in Seattles Capitol Hill neighborhood. The park, decorated with artwork from Tashkent and Seattle children, was a symbol of the citys unique relationship with the Soviet Union and its belief in a distant harmony between the worlds superpowers. In recent years, long after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the park has fallen into disrepair. Though the sister city relationship is still intact, it has faded into the background as the citys homelessness crisis has taken hold in the area. The park, unaffectionately known as Trash Can Park, has all but lost its connection to its own history, obscured by disarray and neglected by the city. Such is the nature of the rich history connecting Seattle to the Soviet Union. Seattles strange Soviet history has faded, at best to a bizarre character in a neighborhood of eccentric liberals and, at worst to a neglected park left to ruin.
What remains is the shadow of radical, Soviet-aligned politics, a reputation that the city cannot shake. Echos of the First and Second Red Scare haunt Seattle as media outlets, citizens, and politicians use the ill-defined threat of communism as a tool to silence protest and dissent. The WTO Protests of 1999, a response to the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference held in Seattle, advocated against the disastrous effects of trade globalization. The conservative
15History
medias response to WTO painted the protestors as violent anarchists who defied global progress and disrupted the city, distracting the conversation from the protestors actual aims. These same tools were used by media outlets in response to the occupation of Capitol Hill in June of 2020, wherein protestors seized six city blocks and established a self-proclaimed autonomous zone in response to the murder of George Floyd. The occupied area, known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) and later the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), was framed by the media as a perverse anarchic settlement of militant communist insurgents. Fox News headline, accompanied by a photo of burning buildings not in Seattle but in St. Paul, reads CRAZY TOWN: Seattle helpless as armed guards patrol anarchists autonomous zone16. The legacy of communism and the Soviet Union in Seattle, then, had become not a facet of the citys history, but a pressing issue of the citys present.

Conclusion
The relationship between Seattle and the Soviet Union, beginning in 1917, has proved instrumental in the formation of the political, economic, and social landscape of current-day Seattle. Though perhaps not easily spotted, the memory of the Soviet Union is deeply present in Seattle. In many ways, Anna Louise Strong was not wrong in her prediction that the Seattle General Strike would lead the city to new places. Strongs vision, rife with post-Bolshevik Revolution idealism, was of a socialist Seattle, controlled by the workers. Nothing of the sort exists today. Strong would be saddened to hear of the failure of Initiative 172, which left a hole in Washington's social safety net, the ramifications of which are still felt today. She would be even more disheartened to hear that the weaponization of the accusation of communism is still a common conservative tactic in 2022. But the Bolshevik Revolution and General Strike, though they did not propel the city into revolution, do represent the beginning of Seattles complex and varied relationship with political radicalism and the Soviet Union. This little-known history is present in the everyday lives of Seattlites. Places like the Space Needle, Bremerton Naval Base, and Tashkent Park serve as physical reminders of the economic and social ramifications of the Cold War in Washington. Surrounded by these artifacts, the city of Seattle watches the living legacy of the First and Second Red Scare play out through the ostracism of protest on the basis of unfounded accusations of revolutionary communist schemes. Post-Soviet Seattle is, so to speak, haunted by the specter of communism.

Introduction 
The first wave of active feminism is best known for the suffragettes and the fight for voting rights for women, but women of the first wave of active feminism held many more goals. Feminists fought for rights to education, property ownership, personal citizenship, personal economy, and participation in government. The feminists of the time chose to focus on the right to vote more than their other goals because they did not have the resources to mobilize enough to achieve each. The fight for suffrage began long before the Seneca Falls Womens convention, but the convention is where women truly began to organize themselves in pursuit of suffrage. The convention was led by Elizabeth Stanton in 1848 and many women attended. The suffragettes were also majority abolitionists, so they had the support of abolitionists who may not have been attracted to their cause otherwise. After the emancipation of millions of slaves, the option of naturalizing or being citizens through birth in the states was extended to all free men, removing the previous provision that only white men could be naturalized. Women however, were still not granted personal citizenship and their citizenship was fully dependent on that of their husbands. With the ratification of the 14th amendment in 1868, the constitution officially overtly mentioned sex. Congress ignored calls for constitutional protection of womens suffrage also in the passing of the 15th amendment in 1870. While the constitution did not guarantee suffrage to women, a few territories had granted them the right to vote by 1870. In spite of these strides toward suffrage for women that the states were taking, many suffragettes were outraged that congress did not honor their petitions for constitutionally protected rights. An example of this is in comments made by Stanton praising the educated white woman and claiming her education made her ready to vote in United States democracy, whereas African Americans and naturalized immigrants lacked such preparedness to exercise the rights of a citizen. The issue of clashes between certain women and other minority groups became increasingly important and divisive as time moved on, but at the time, Stanton received little backlash. With the fight for suffrage left up to the states, the feminsit party split: Stanton and Susan B. Anthony created the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869 and aimed at individual states to amend their voting laws to cause a ripple effect: Also in 1869, Lucy Stone, a one-time Massachusetts antislavery advocate and a prominent lobbyist for womens rights formed the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). While the NWSA took more personal steps in attempting to change the states legislature, the AWSA took the same approach that Stone had when advocating for emancipation. The AWSA flooded state congresses with petitions in support of womens suffrage, but both the NWSA and the AWSA had little success in swaying states. The two groups eventually came together in the late 1880s to form the NAWSA. This new association was led by Stanton then Anthony, and was far less welcoming of women of color than the AWSA had been. However, success was found as states began to grant women suffrage. Finally, after decades of petitioning, congress passed the 19th amendment and it was ratified, granting constitutional protections for womens suffrage in every state. Unfortunately, because the citizenship of a husband determined the status of his wife, courts became reluctant to grant immigrants citizenship because they wanted to prevent the wives from voting. The problem grew until 1922 when women were given personal citizenship, allowing them to obtain citizenship in the same way a man would. The apparent activism of the time died down after suffrage was granted, possibly because of the recent WWI and the great depression into WWII. it is important to note that feminism did not die down, the activism for feminism did. It would be around 4 decades until feminist activism reached another peak, and at that peak, the issues of the alientation of certain women from the early feminist movement would also peak.
Second Wave Feminism:
-Late 1960s the revival of feminism 
-Simone de Beauvoir published her book The Second Sex in France in 1949
-The book was published in the U.S. in 1953 
-The Second Sex held many defintions of womanhood and explained the history of opression against women
-Beauvoir defines what is a woman? in her book and determines one is not born but becomes a woman.
-Betty Friedan released her book The Feminine Mystique in 1963 
-Friedan built off Beauvoirs work, but also incorporated oral accounts of womens histories and interviews with other white housewives 
-The book contained uniting accounts of malaise and dissatisfaction among women
-By showing that many women felt the same about their secondary roles, Friedans book helped to ignite the second wave
-Led by Esther Peterson, a group of women led to President John F. Kennedy signing the Equal Pay Act of 1963 into law 
-The act stated that women could not be paid less for comparable work to a man
-https://youtu.be/o5JktYOxkkg
-Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 potected workers from discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or national orgin
-Griswold v. Connecticut Supreme Court ruling of 1965 protected womens access to contraceptives
-Women of color
-The Civil rights movement was in full swing at the time of the second wave of feminism, so women of color who had been fighting for their rights as people of color began to also fight for their rights as women
-Frances M. Beal wrote an essay Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female
-Beal noted the exploitation of black women in society and the differences in experience between white and non-white feminists
-In 1969, Friedan stepped down from leading the National Organization for Women (NOW), a organization she co-founded
-NOW was radically inclusive, but concerns of black women were often sidelined and Friedan had clashed with black members about her use of the 1964 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to advocate for jobs for white women when many black americans faced job discrimination and lived under the poverty line
-By 1969, black women had begun their own organizations
-National Black Feminist Organization (NBFO) in 1973
-The Combahee River Collective formed in 1974
-The collective also focused on issues of sexuality, unlike NBFO and other organizations
-They were the first organization to openly advocate intersectionality of race, sex, sexuality, and class, where others would only focus on race and sex
-Angela Davis published articles and essays on the experience of black feminists and published Women, Race & Class in 1981
-The term Black feminism grew to mean what we would now call intersectional feminism as women of color wrote books, essays, and articles illustrating that their feminism meant equality for all
-Womanism was coined by Alice Walker, an author and black feminism activist, and the term was used interchangably with black feminism
-Lesbian feminists
-With the pick up of the LGBTQ+ rights movement in the 1960s and after Stonewall in 1969, lesbians began to branch off to create their own organizations seperate from those run by men
-Lesbians and other gay women attempted to join and bring their issues to NOW, but they were rejected
-They held a demonstration at the Second Congress to Unite Women in 1970
-The NOW acknowledged them and adopted a resolution acknowledging lesbian rights in 1971
-The NOW also created the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism in 1973
-Queer women of color also began to join the femist movement after the inclusive changes
-Reproductive rights
-The birth control pill was introduced to market in 1960
-The sale was illegal in many states
-Many religions held in their opposition to contraceptives
-In 1965, in GRISWOLD V. CONNECTICUT, the supreme court ruled that sale of contraceptives to married couples was an infringement on the constitutional right to privacy 
-1972 EISENSTADT V. BAIRD the supreme court ruled that unmarried people could not be barred from purchasing contraceptives because of a lack of rational reasoning on why married and unmarried individuals should be treated differently when it comes to access to contraceptives
-1973 Roe v. Wade the supreme court ruled that the right to abortion was constitutionally protected
-Sexual revolution 
-With women questioning their roles and with narratives about women changing, women began to embrace their sexuality
-The sexual revolution was the understanding that women had the same sexual desires as men and deserved to be treated equally in their sexual endeavors
-Conservatives fought against this embrace of sexual identity as it attacked the long held American idenety of family values
-While men were praised for their sexual conquests women are shamed for having sexual relations or even desires outside of wedlock
-The release of the birth control pill was a convenient scapegoat for conservatives as they could use the empowerment it gave to women of family planning to blame promiscuity on it
-Conservatives fought against the pill because it allowed women sexual freedom by seperating sex and procreation
-They argued that the risk of pregnancy is what prevents women from premarital sex and affairs
-Studies by the creators of the pill contradicted conservative claims, showing that women were having premarital sex at the same rates, they were just using less effective forms of contraception 
-While conservatives framed the sexual revolution as an even caused by access to family planning tools, the sexual revolution resulted from the illumination of the womans sexual experience
-The efforts to destigmatize women and sex continue to this day with calls to increase sexual education and with anti-slut-shaming media initiatives 
-Bra burning protest of 1968
-Women protested the Miss America pageant in New Jersey in 1968 with the purpose of protesting unrealistic beauty standards
-They threw bras, high heels, playboy magazines, and other representers of beauty standards into trash cans

The revival of feminist activism occured in the mid 60s. Many attribute the rise in activism to and increase in feminist literature and ideas, an example of which being The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvior. The book was originally published in France in 1949, but it was adapted and publed in the United States in 1953. In her book, Beauvoir defines many expressions of womanhood and explains the long history of oppression of women. One of her most important definitions is that of a woman. Beauvoir attempts to define woman and she came to the idea that one is not born but becomes a woman. The book and its definitions of the female experience stir up the female community, but it was not until Betty Friedan released her book, The Feminine Mystique in 1963 that the movement of the second wave began. Friedan builds off of Beauvoir in her book, but adds personal accounts she collected from housewives. Friedan was a journalist and writer before settling down with a family and becoming a housewife. She found that she was unfulfilled without her work as a writer, and in her interviews she found that many women shared her sentiment. With the unification that The Feminine Mystique brought to dissatisfied housewives, women began a crusade to redefine female roles to include work outside the home. The women wanted equal working opportunities and conditions, to remove the expectation that they would become subservient to their families and give up their dreams. A great step toward equality in the workplace was taken in 1963 when a group of women led by Esther Peterson led President John F. Kennedy to sign the Equal Pay Act into law. The act stated that companies could no longer pay women less for equal work to a man. But, the momentum only picked up from there when Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, protecting workers from discrimination on basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin. These two laws that provided protections for women in the workplace were then used by feminist groups like the Ntional Organization for Women (NOW) to promote women getting jobs and having personal economy. 
Women were also taking part in many other revolutionary movements at this time, helping shape the feminism they had and what we have today.
The civil rights movement had been going on for a long time by the time the second wave of feminist activism begun, so women of color who had been fighting for their rights as people of color would also fight for their rights as women. Unfortunately, in both movements, their concerns were often brushed to the side. Black and brown women flocked to the NOW, which was radically inclusive, but there were disputes over Friedans (a co-founder and the leader of NOW at the time) about the usage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Women of color disagreed with Friedans use of the title to encourage white women to enter the workforce as many people of color faced greater job discrimination and were below the poverty line. The women left the NOW to form their own organizations specifically for women of color. By 1969, black women had begun their organizations, including the National Black Feminist Organization (NBFO). Later, in 1974, the Combahee River Collective formed as an even more inclusive organization that NOW and NBFO. The collective focused on issues of women from all different backgrounds and included women of different races, sexualities, and classes. They were the first group to openly advocate for the intersectionality of race, sex, sexuality, and class where others would only focus on race and sex. Because of the inclusivity of these groups, Black Feminism grew to mean what we would now call intersectional feminism, that is, the belief that everyone deserves equality and human rights. Though, to prevent confusion, Womanism was a term coined by Alice Walker, an author and black feminist activist, and the term became interchangable with Black Feminism.
Another movement going on in the late 60s was the pickup of the LGBTQ+ rights movement. After Stonewall in 1969, lesbians began to participate in more activism for their sexuality and began to bransh off from the main movement run by men to create seperate organizations. Queer women were less welcomed by the NOW than black women were, as they were rejected when they attempted to join and bring their issues to the organization. To protest the rejection, they held a demonstration at the Second Congress to Unite Women in 1970, leading to the NOW adopting a resolution acknowledging the rights of queer women in 1971. With the resoltuion in place and the later creation of the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism in 1973, queer women of color began to join the feminist movemnet as well. Lesbians and queer women were generally accepted into the feminist movemnet until later nearing the end of the second wave that they were associated with violent pornography and became the targets of extreme anti-porn feminists. However, it is more likley that those who targeted queer women were looking for an excuse and were unable to find such a good one until the close of the second wave. 
Women were also going through a sexual revolution with the second wave with the introduction of the birth control pill to markets in 1960. At the time of the introduction, women were questioning their roles and the changing narratives of what it meant to be a woman allowed many to embrace their sexuality. The sexual revolution was the understanding that women have the same sexual desires and men and deserve to be treated equally in their sexual endeavors. The sexual revolution has paved the way for current an previous calls for increased sexual education and anti-slut shaming initiatives. The freedom that the revolution provided to women angered many conservatives, so family planning programs and tools were fought against. When the pill was first introduced, its sale was illegal in many states and religions spoke out about their opposition to the contraceptive. In 1965 though, in Griswold v. Connecticut, the supreme court ruled that the sale of contraceptives to married couples is protected under the constitutional right to privacy. This allowed married couples to engage in intercourse without such a high risk of procreation and allowed for women to have more freedom in their relationships. The protections on the sale of contraceptives went further in 1972 when in Eisenstadt v. Baird, the supreme court ruled that the distinction between married and unmarried individuals had no logical basis, so the criminalization of contraceptive sale to unmarried individuals is unconstitutional. This led to single women having much more freedom and allowed them to have more successful careers. While conservatives cried out against the protection of contraceptives, saying that the tools would lead to an increase in promiscuity in women, rates of premarital sex did not increase in any significant way. Conservatives continued their outrage at the access to family planning and continued to perpetrate sexist views of sexuality, men being conquerors and women being conquests. Those views would not change, however the changes in how society viewed womens sexuality would continue to change. Gloria Steinem wrote an expose on the PlayBoy Club after going undercover as a PlayBoy Bunny. She wrote about the horrible conditions that faced women in the club and about the low wages and sexism they faced in their work. After publishing her book, Steinem began the New York and Ms. magazines, in which she discussed abortion, suxual assult, and other such issues. In 1973, the right to abortion was granted in the supreme court decision of Roe v. Wade, but attacks on abortion rights would and will continue. 
Steinem and other women continued to advocate for women in the magazines and continued to fuel the sexual and reproductive revolutions. Nearing the end of the second wave though, feminists began to split into 2 camps, one being sex positive and the other being anti-pornography. The names of these 2 camps are deceiving though because the initial quest of anti-porn feminists was to remove violent depictions of sex from media. The idea was that violence agianst women in porn led to more violence against women in real life. They also brought up the issues surrounding consent in the videos, questioning how one could tell if the woman gave consent and noting that the lack of consent in many of the videos teaches a lack of emphasis on it. The anti-porn movement was soon picked up by conservatives, so it soon became twisted into a movement to remove all porn that is offensive to a viewer. The anti-porn movement became one that was anti-speech. Requests for legislature to govern the spread of any offensive porn were shot down by the supreme court due to the infringement of free speech, but during the time the laws were active, they put sexual educators at risk. We have returned to the place of anti-violent porn, a belief held by many feminists, but now the gonvernace is left up to people stigmatizing the overt objectification and harm of women. 
While the anti-porn movement was a failure due to the infringement on freedom of speech, a different goal of the second wave was the prevention and the punishment of rape. Although most rapes are perpetrated by someone the victim knows, Take Back the Night is a marching initiative to demonstrate against rape. The first march was held in San Fransisco in 1978, and since then marches have been held all over the U.S.. While the marching is helpful toward the cause of preventing and criminalizing rape, as said most perpetrators know their victims personally, so legislative change was also advocated for. This is because, prior to 1976, there was a nearly absolute exception for marital rape in all 50 states. The first state to criminalize the act was Nebraska in 1976. Many conservatives and traditionalists opposed the criminalization of marital rape for sexist reasons that mostly jisted to women being property. There were objections based on old British common law of viewing wives as property, there were objections based on the belief that signing a marriage contract meant giving consent to sex at any time for the rest of time, and conserns about the government getting involved in the personal relationship of marriage. Ultimately, none of the arguments stood the test of logic or time as bu 1993, all states had at least partially criminalized marital rape. Currently, 20 states have an exception to the criminalization for cases in which the spouse was unable to give consent at the time, presumably on the assumption that they would have had they been physically able to. Sexual violence opposition groups are still working to get that changed, or at least put marital rape in the category of domestic abuse, to lessen the burned on the victim and to criminalize a horrific, violent crime. 
Many of the things being fought for now were introduced in the second wave of feminist activism, this includes the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) stating that, Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. This amendment was actually introduced by Alice Paul (a feminist from Britan that founded the Natinal Womens Party in 1913) in 1923. The amendment has been fought for from the time of its introduction to the time of its passage through the senate in 1972, and it continues to be fought for. Hawaii was the first to ratify it and 30 other states followed within a year of the ERA passing, but the required 38 states did not ratify it. Virginia became the last state needed to ratify it in 2020, but now the amendment is facing bureaucratic red tape from a rule that an amendment must be ratified within 7 years of its passage to be added to the constitution. The fight for constitutionally protected equality will continue and as will the fight for equality in all areas of life.
Third Wave Feminism:
The third wave of feminism was characterized by its agressive inclusivity, its focus on female empowerment, and the shaping of the feminist identity.There were two catalysts to the swell of feminist activism and identity in the 1990s. The first was the Riot Grrrl movement that began in 1989 and the second was the live televised hearings for supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas. The hearing began after the Riot Grrrl movement, but Riot Grrrl took more time to gain a reaction from followers. The hearing was so influential to women across the country at the time and now because it featured a former coworker of Thomas coming forward about her experiences with him sexually harrassing her in the workplace. The hearings led to more women coming forward about their experiences with sexual harrassment and abuse and drew awareness to the issues of sexual harrassment in the workplace. The work of exposing sexual harrassment has continued with #MeToo and other such movements. The Riot Grrrl movement also encouraged women to speak about their experiences, but they encouraged women to speak about all their experiences. The Riot Grrrl movement provided safe spaces for women in punk concerts. The movement encouraged women to put together bands or create other art and literature to advocate for themselves. Riot Grrrl was geared toward women and provided them safe spaces, but also advocated for positive femininity and masculinity and provided men with spaces to speak about their experiences too. Riot Grrrl helped to unify feminists under the identity of the female experience and with the ideal of female empowerment.
Anita Hill was an African American woman, a feminist, a professor, and a lawyer. She came from a small town in Oklahoma, and after going to law school, she began her career at a law firm in Washington D.C.. She soon left to joining the U.S. Department of Educations Office for Civil Rights where she worked as a legal advisor to Clarence Thomas, an African American man. Thomas eventually became chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Hill followed him there to continue as his legal advisor. She left the job one year later though due to unbearable working conditions and accepted a teaching position at Oral Roberts University. In 1986, she moved back to her home state to become a professor at Oklahoma University, and she became the first african american tenured professor at OU in 1989. In 1991, George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the supreme court, so Hill came forward to testify against Thomas due to him sexually assulting her during her time working with him. She recounted situations in which he would sexually assult her during both her time as a legal advisor and when she worked under him at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The reason she left his employment was due to intolerable working conditions he created through his harassment. The televised hearing sparked political polarization between people believing that she was a scorned woman just wanting attention, and those who were appalled at the sexist treatment she received from senators while testifying. Both Hill and Thomas were African Americans, but Thomas referred to the hearing as a high tech lynching to suggest that he was being persicuted because of his race rather than because of his sexist actions against Hill. Thomas was appointed to the supreme court despite her testimony, but Hill brought awareness to the issues of workplace sexual harassment by coming forward about her experience. Hill was later forced to leave OU in 1996 due to calls for her resignation. She had become a feminist inspiration though and many more women came forward about their esperiences with workplace sexual harrassment and their general experiences with sexual harrassment. The populus was polarized over hatred for her, leading to her having to leave OU, and support for her mixed with rage at the sexist treatment she faced when testifying. In a show of support for Hill, women across the country raised thousands of dollars to purchase a full page ad in the New York Times titled, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves.  The page included a manifesto criticizing the treatment of Hill saying, We are particularly outraged by the racist and sexist treatment of Professor Anita Hill, an African American woman who was maligned and castigated for daring to speak publicly of her own experience of sexual abuse, and 1,600 signatures from women across the U.S.. Aside from the event itself proving that it was a spark for the third wave, the political climate resulting from the hearing was referred to as the The Third Wave by Rebecca Walker, daughter of second wave icon, Alice Walker.
Anita Hill also inspired women to fight for more representation in congress as she testified before a committee of all white, all male senators. Many credit the inspiration from Hill for the groundbreaking numbers of women elected into congress in 1992. More women were elected to congress than in any previous decade and the number of women in the house and senate about doubled. The year was deemed The Year of Women. The other entity that is celebrated for the victory for women is the organization EMILYs List. The organization was founded in 1985 by Ellen R. Malcolm and has provided funds to democratic, pro choice women from its founding to now. The organizations name means, Early Money Is Like Yeast, meaning that they raised money early so that other donors would come to their endorsed candidates campaigns and the campaign would rise like dough does with yeast. As time has pressed on, more women have been elected into congress and more women have spoken up about sexual harrassment. Anita Hill paved the way for the #MeToo movement and women advocating for themselves.
Punk music feminism took on the title of the Riot Grrrl movement and started in 1989. The movement took time to become popular, but one of the catalysts to the popularization was the founding of Bikini Kill in Olympia, Washington. Bikini Kill rose to become one of the most popular punk feminist groups along with Bratmobile and Heavens to Betsy. As women started to go to the shows of punk feminists, the movement quickly became widespread and other bands poped up all over the U.S. and later around the world. Riot Grrrl encouraged women to create bands and music or art and literature about their experiences with sexism. Riot Grrrl groups addressed sexism, patriarchy, abuse, sexuality, privlage, and rape. Following in the footsteps of The Guerrilla Girls of 1985 and their public displays of art and music exposing sexism, Riot Grrrl groups and their zines exposed issues women and men faced regarding sexism. Kathleen Hanna, the lead singer of Bikini Kill, was a forerunner of the Riot Grrrl Feminist movement and she created multiple publications for womens empowerment. The Bikini Kill Zine was created after Hanna collaborated with other artists on Riot Grrrl, a small magazine, and by 1991, the Bikini Kill Zine published the Riot Grrrl Manifesto. The manifesto outlined the reasons for the recent surge in musical feminist activism, called for people to accept their feminine traits because femininity is not bad, and preached sisterhood between women. Riot Grrrl is also responsible for many of the feminist phrases we still use. Hanna was known for empowering women at her concerts, saying, Revolution Girl Style Now! or Girls to the front! The Riot Grrrl concerts provided a safe space for women and the calls became symbolic of the call for women to express themselves and come to the forefront of male-dominated fields. The Riot Grrrl movement moved away from the term feminist because they felt the association of past feminists with racist and homophobic beleifs and actions. The term still persists, but is redefined as someone who believes in equality for everyone without dependence on race, sexuality, or gender. Riot Grrrl also fought against notions that femininity is weak or bad and encouraged both men and women to embrace their individuality and not conform to toxic expectations. As the Riot Grrrl movement progressed more bands arose across the country and many of these bands would play their music at pro-choice rallies and would advocate for womens reproductive rights. As the Riot Grrrl movement popularized, terminology was adopted by mainstream bands, like the Spice Girls, which was good to spread the message, but became problematic because the media would mistake pop groups not part of the political feminist Riot Grrrl movement as parts because of the language adoption. Not all of the language lost its meaning, for example, Bikini Kill often said Girl Power and the phrase was soon adopted by mainstream artists, but it is one of the few phrases that kept its meaning and is still used today. As the movement popularized and the media mistook non-political groups for Riot Grrrl groups, several Riot Grrrl groups dissolved, but many members continued to make political music. Bikini Kill released their last album in 1996, but Kathleen Hanna continued to make feminist activist music. The feminism of Riot Grrrl groups resonated with some women in a way that mainstream, cookie cutter feminism didnt because of the focus on being true to yourself and creating safe spaces for everyone. Though the movement ended in the U.S., branches arose in Asia, Europe, Australia, and Latin America. Additionally, though the music went out of style, the movement created the intersectional feminism we have today. 
There were positives and negatives about the third wave. One possitive was the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994. The act provided additional criminalization of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Additionally, in 1995, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) within the Department of Justice (DOJ) was founded. The VAWA and the OVW provided grounds and funding for more prevention initiatives and more survivor care facilities and programs. The VAWA was reauthorized repeatedly, in 2000, 2005, 20013, and 2021. Its initial passage and repeated reauthorization were spearheaded by groups such as the NOW, the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, the Family Violence Prevention Fund, and many other state and local organizations. The reauthorizations of 2013 and 2021 are notable however because they were elongated by republican/conservative disagreement with some of the proposed added clauses. The proposed clauses were to include more protections for native women, same-sex couples, and sex trafficing victims, and a resolution to eradicate the boyfriend loophole which allows domestic abusers to purchase firearms. One negative of the time was the creation of Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project, for those who were struggling to form loving relationships 1997. This is a negative of the time because after forming a relationship for herself, Alana stopped monitoring the website and it became overrun with misogynistic men who became the online group now referred to as incels.

https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4999257/user-clip-representative-pennsylvania-questioning-hillFourth Wave Feminism:
It is unclear when the third wave ended and when the fourth wave began, some believe that the tip was in 2000, others believe that it happened in 2012. In either case, the change occurred with the rise of social media and the benefits and dangers that it posed and poses. The identity of a feminist as one who believe in equality for all people and one who acknowleges and respects the rights of other minorities and minority women continued to develop well into the 2000s and continues to develop today. With the rise of social media sites like facebook, twitter, instagram, and more, the world became closer than ever before. This resulted in feminists from all around the world being able to connect, share, and empower themselves and each other. 
The 2000s saw a change in fashion and a rise in opposition to unrealistic body standards and the expectation of women to be jealous and hateful of each other. The 2004 movie Mean Girls was a show of the pressure women face to be beautiful and the expectation of them to be cruel to each other and was a satire on the practices caused by the internalized sexism. The film featured Lindsey Lohan and followed the story of a teen girl named Kady as she navigated highschool after being homeschooled in Africa her whole life. The movie criticized the bullying that occurs in schools based on weight, perceived sexual activity, conventional beauty, academic achevement, etc. and ended with a call for unification of women. The empowering message of women needing to lift each other up rather than tear each other down resonated with teens and adults and helped lead to the recognition of internalized sexism causing arbitrary, harmful divides between women. The movie became an iconic piece of culture for teens of 2004 and onward, but the main emulations of aspects of the movie in following media were the three popular, mean girls rather than the messages of sisterhood and inner beauty. The reaction from audiences showed and shows the value that the current generations put on sisterhood and women supporting women (a phrase that would become extremely popular among feminists online), but the following media imitating the mean girls shows the continued belief that jokes at the expense of women and their empowerment are funny and sell. 
An aspect of fourth wave feminism is also the understanding of internalized sexism among women and the effort to remove those effects. One example that has been fought against since the second wave is toxic femininity, the belief that women should only carry perceived feminine traits. Toxic femininity is the expectation that women are, or should be, submissive, quiet, calm, agreeable, accommodating, etc.; all traits that build the expectation and build on the expectation that women are less and can only be less than men. In response to these projected expectations, women have flooded social media outlets with messages of empowerment for other women, telling them that they are allowed to take space for their existence. The expectations of toxic femininity have been used to villainize powerful women by criticizing them for speaking like men are expected. An example of this were ads villainizing Hillary Clinton as a shrill, power hungry woman by showing clips of her discussing political issues. The understanding of the internalization of these expectations is also pivotal to the fourth wave. Women are far more encouraged to advocate for themselves than ever before and to notice when they feel they are taking too much space because of something said to them based on their sex, then continue to take that space. This empowerment of women to advocate what they want and need has received much backlash from traditional conservatives who claim that the women are not filling their proper roles, and that women are selfish for expressing themselves. These claims tie back to the stereotype created in 1968 of the angry, man-hating feminist because a common reaction to women countering their male counterparts in respectful ways spark comments about the woman just hating all men. 
On the other side of the spectrum of toxic standards of women, there is the Not Like Other Girls trend, or more popularly recognized as the Pick Me Girl trend. The Pick Me Girl trend refers to girls who pretend to, or over exaggerate their enjoyment of typically male associated activities to seem different from other girls (referring to those who are more feminine). This trend is inherently sexist as it perpetuates the falsity that femininity is bad, and contributes to the hate culture between women by making an us and a them (pick me girls and the other girls they are not like). Pick me girls first popularized on twitter in 2016, but the term is much more widely recognized now with trends making fun of pick me girls and the sexist beliefs that create them. Pick me girls will make shows of liking things like video games, cars, fighting, and other things men are supposed to like in an attempt to gain the attention and approval of men by being like them. Pick me girls may also bully other girls for doing feminine things like wearing makeup and dresses, and have been know to be defensive of sexual assaulters. The pick me girl follows the trend of the girl who is not like other girls. This not like other girls girl has been popularized in the media and is often found when looking at book heroines, sometimes it is even explicitly stated in the media that the girl is not like other girls. This carries with it the belief that being like other girls is a bad thing and copies the sexist belief that femininity is akin to weakness and failure. In response to the pick me girls and the trend of not like other girl protagonists in media, feminists on social media have made many videos making fun of the exagerated masculinity of pick me girls and started the I Am Like Other Girls trend. The videos poking fun at pick me girls are harmful to the community, but many people find them funny so they remain popular. Expecting women to be supportive of each other and helpful of each other is contradicted by making fun of women who have internalized sexism, and there is still the need for the questioning of the pick me girl. Videos now will show positive reactions to feminine women and negative reactions to pick me girls to show that being feminine is a good thing and to show that being a pick me girl is not always received well. Along with the more positive responses is the I Am Like Other Girls trend where girls will say how they are like other girls and list the positive attributes of women. In either case of internalized sexism being reacted to, it is clear that the connections provided by social media have led to many more trends and movements than ever before because of the immediate ability to react to content. 
The feminist movements on social media have been beneficial to womens and mens mental health because of their gender inclusive targeting. One of the most beneficial is the avid opposition of feminists to unrealistic body standards for both men and women. While the issues of male eating disorders and body image issues have yet to be fully addressed, the feminist body positivity movement has helped men and women. A trend on tiktok and instagram in recent years has been Eat A Meal With Me, a trend in which influencers and others film themselves eating and having a mock conversation with the person watching the video. The trend was started to help people with eating disorders accept themselves and not feel lonely when eating as many prefer to eat without other people around. The trend also showed people with bodies that many find beautiful eating to show that eating is a healthy thing. There are also posts all over social media that are check-up type of content that tells the watcher or reader to check themselves for discomforts like dehydration, or hunger, or poor posture and reminds them to take care of themselves. 
There has also been an increase in anti-sexual assault movements online and off. One of the most notable instances of a show of support for womens rights was the Womens March on Washington on January 21st, 2017, the day after Trumps inauguration. The march was to protest Trump and show the support of womens rights in America. Many women were scared for their rights when Trump, an overtly sexist and proven sexual assulter (charges of pedophilia and rape are still pending), took office. Over 4.6 million people attended various women's marches throughout the U.S. on the date of the Womens March. The demonstrations showed widespread support for women and for the continuation of protections for womens rights and gained worldwide recognition. The march also occurred in the same year that the #MeToo Movement is said to have truly blown up and mainstreamed the media. The movement was begun in 2006 and became more and more popular on social media as time went on, but the movement truly went viral when famous women of Hollywood came forward with sexual assault alegations against music producer Jeffrey Epstien. The women sparked widespread recognition of the sexual harrassment and assault of women in the workplace and many women came forward with allegations. As #MeToo gained more traction, so did the attempts at discreditation of the allegations and personal attacks on the women who were victimized. Many accused the women of being scorned and in search of attention. Especially with the case of Brock Turner the year before in 2016, the environment fostered the Not All Men opposition movement to #MeToo. The movement was by men who were worried about being falsely accused of sexual assult for their actions, so they began the trend of disbelieving women who reported sexual assult, with the tagline, Not All Men. Anti-feminists used this phrase to invalidate the experience of sexual assault of the 1 in 3 women who experienced it. They also used not all men with the angry, man-hating stereotype of feminists to frame survivors of sexual abuse and harassment as liars who just wanted to ruin the reputations of the men they were assulted by. The online feminsit movement responded to not all men with the Not All Men But All Women movement. The movement responded to the men attempting to discredit women by saying that not all men were assaulters with the truth of all women having to live in constant anxiety of the men that are sexual assulters. The movement included, not all men; but all women are scared to walk alone at night, and not all men; but all women keep one earbud out to listen for following footsteps. The movement was effective in its acknowledgment of not all men being sexual assulters, and in it illustration of the fact that because some are, all women must be on alert. 
In 2018 Times Up, an initiative fighting rape culture, officially began. Rape culture is a culture in which instances of sexual assult are normalized and widly accepted as something that is not a problem or something to be joked about. The Times Up initiative has criticized sexual assault jokes and had called for all men to call out those they see perpetuating rape culture. The initiative is also critical of men who bring up men getting raped only as a reaction to dampen the experiences of women. The anti-rape movement is not gendered, nor does it deny the experiences of men, but men opposing the movement will tend to bring up men getting raped only when women come forward about their experiences. The anti-rape movement and Times Up both call for social reform to destigmatize coming forward about experiences with sexual assult and to stigmatize the jokes and criticism of surviors who speak up. The movement also calls for the end of victim blaming. The end of comments such as, what were you wearing?, were you drunk?, did you say no?, did you try to get them to stop?, youll ruin their life, etc.. The social media of the anti-rape movement has also been growing as more aritists create art to inform people and art to protest rape and rape cultutre. The growth of anti-rape culture and female empowerment and assault survivor empowerment is helping to create a safer place for everyone. 
What has not created a safer space for everyone is the anonymity of the internet allowing people to virtually harass and threaten others. Two of the best known examples of the dangers caused by extremist sexist groups on the internet are GamerGate and the violence that has been directly linked to the incel community. 
The incel community was actually begun by a woman, though she did not intend for it to turn into the violent, misogynistic group that it is today. A woman named Alana started Alanas Involuntarily Celebate Project, an online chat community for lonely men and women in 1997 who were having trouble getting into relationships. The site began as a place where men and women could give each other dating advice and encouragement about themselves. But, after Alana got into a relationship herself, she stopped monitoring the site. The server soon populated with misogynistic men who blame women for their misfortunes in dating. The community eventually moved to 4chan upon its opening and then spread to nearly all social media sites. They were then given the nickname incels. Incels blame women they refer to as Stacys for their inability to find a relationship, and blame women for being shallow or difficult. They also express anger toward men who can get into relationships, those they call Chads because of their jealousy. They perpetuate the stereotype that Chads are singularly conventionally beautiful men and are only picked for their outer appearance. Incels are also perpetrators of the nice guys finish last idea. They think of themselves as nice guys and the fact that women do not want to be with them is infuriating to them. The group thrives off a sense of entitlement to women and womens attention, effectively treating women as property. The servers of incels are not welcoming to any women and will ban them if found. One of the first and most explicit linkers of the incel community and violence was the Isla Vista rampage by an active member of the incel community. The link was easily established as the man had frequented misogynistic online communities before the murders, had posted videos about his hatred for women, and had posted repeatedly about his intent to get revenge for the injustice of not having women flock to him. The most important and obvious link though, was a memoir that he posted just before his homicidal rampage that contained his reasons for hating women and his meticulous planning of the rampage to get revenge. He posted the memoir, stabbed his 3 male roommates over 150 times in total in their shared apartment, then drove into a crowd of people and opened fire on them. After killing 3 more people with gunfire for a total of 6 deaths and injuring many more, and a police shootout, he killed himself. The act was praised on incel forums and comments were made asking when the next one would be and expressing hope for a more deadly rampage next time. This happened again in 2019 when a social media influencer named Bianca Devins was murdered by her ex-boyfriend. The murderer posted photos of the influencers corpse on discord and they quickly spread through social media. He also took a video of him killing her but that was not posted. Incels and other extremist groups then sent the images to the influencers family along with threats and claims that she deserved what happened to her. The instances have continued and one can find threatening comments on feminist posts and general posts. Some women have spoken out about harassment and threats on social media, but little has been done to help them. With the murder of Bianca, the family has petitioned for a federal law that holds companies accountable for the damaging and disturbing images that are posted to their sites. Although some sites have added more security and content control precautions, many continue to put the burden of protecting people from disturbing media on the viewer. The increase in communication channels has also created places for violent individuals to egg each other on and the anonymity has allowed people to openly praise instances of violence toward women. Moving forward, media companies must place more restrictions on who is allowed on their sites and must improve their content vetting programs. 
There was also the GamerGate incident that went from 2012 to 2014 when the group of harassers was adopted into the alt-right. The climate exposed in GamerGate began long before 2012. The video gaming industry has been historically advertised toward men and the gaming community is notoriously sexist and exclusive of women gamers. In 2012 though, feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian shifted her critique from movies onto games as well. She received intense backlash and GamerGate began with the flood of doxxing efforts (efforts to expose her personal information such as her home address), and bomb, rape, and murder threats. One of her speeches at a college had to be canceled due to bomb and shooting threats from the online gamer community. GamerGate also involved a female game developer who broke up with her boyfriend at the time for another man. In response to the breakup, her boyfriend doxxed her and claimed that she had cheated on him during their relationship. She, like Sarkeesian, got a storm of threats and hatred from the gaming community. The incident did not end, rather morphed when the harassing gamer community was absorbed into the alt-right. So, while the feminist community is becoming more widespread, the anti-feminist groups are becoming far more polarized than ever. I also feel it is important to note that the number of intimate partner homicides has been increasing since 2013. While this may only be correlated with the online harassment of women and the encouragement from groups to perpetuate violence against women, I feel it is an important thing to note when considering the real world violence caused by online hatred. 
With Trump encouraging outward bigotry and with the anonymity of the internet allowing people to dehumanize others and avoid consequences through claims of joking or trolling, the world continues to be a dangerous place for women. However, with the connections that social media provides, the feminist movement has mobilized on a scale never seen before. Feminism will continue to grow and activism may ebb at some point soon, or it will be perpetual on social media. We cannot predict the future, but we can learn from the past, and what the past has taught us about feminism is that it will continue to become more progressive, inclusive, and prevelent. It has also taught us that the fostering of internet extremism leads to violence and the allowance of media companies to not properly moderate their forums must end to prevent further sexual injustice.

Ethics & Citizenship 
5 September 2021 
Prompt: Based on what you just read, and what you have seen in the news, what do you think the next 4 years will contain in terms of nationalism and the debate over the future of the country? 
Nationalism is the devotion to ones country founded upon a disdain of other countries. Depending on who we see in office in the years to come, and what beliefs that person holds, we may see increases or decreases in nationalism. Perhaps the most impactful ideal a president can hold is a true understanding of the nations history; both our strengths and our many shortcomings. What nationalism fails to understand is that scrutiny of a countrys past and present actions is what helps the country to correct itself, and ignoring - even cutting out - the worst parts of American history does more harm than help.When serious historians abandon the study of the nation, when scholars stop trying to write a common history for the people, nationalism doesnt die. Instead, it eats liberalism (20). If, in the future, we can elect a president who understands this, we, as a country, can work to disassemble the impact and existence of nationalism.  
But the United States, rebuked by all those left out in its vision of a nation, began battling that contradiction early on, and has never stopped. In the United States, the nation is that battle (42). 
In order to predict the future of that battle in this country, it is necessary to examine the past and present. Currently, one of the biggest issues concerning nationalism is refugees from Afghanistan. Nationalism is inherently resentful of immigration because it involves accepting foreigners as part of the country. President Biden seems willing to allow Afghan refugees into the country and ... pledged that all evacuated Afghan allies will be given a home in the United States.. (New York Times). However, there are still some, mainly right-wing conservatives given media platforms, who are hostile to the idea of welcoming refugees, much like former president Trump. 
Bidens immigration policy is more accepting than his predecessors, and does make strides in dismantling the nationalist sentiments imposed by Trump. If future presidents take a similar approach to Biden, we may see nationalism decrease even more.   
However, history, being the pendulum it is, may swing in an opposite direction for the 2024 election. If Donald Trump were elected again, the country would likely see another rise in this type of outwardly vicious nationalism - much like what was seen in the last year or so of Trumps presidency. Trump refused to condemn nationalist, white supremacist groups like the KKK and Proud boys, and in doing so gave permission for blatant hate and violence to run rampant. Meanwhile, those who decide to protest these actions are derided by the President. From Colin Kaepernick and Meghan Rapinoe - who were ridiculed and insulted by Donald Trump for kneeling for the national anthem - to those who, later, marched and protested the killing of George Floyd and about whom Trump tweeted These Anarchists, not protesters, are Biden voters, but he has no control and nothing to say. Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs. To quote Jill Lepore, The nation is often wrong. But so long as protest is possible it can always be righted (52). Yet, when these protests are deemed contemptible by the President of the United States, the process of righting the wrong - of fighting nationalism - becomes much more difficult. If Donald Trump, or someone who holds similar beliefs, were to become the President in 2024, nationalism would likely be allowed to spread freely. 
Though it is impossible to truly predict the future, we can base our assumptions on past and present experiences with those in power, and what impact their views made on Americans. Some presidents chose to fight the fire of nationalism, while others fan its flames.

	The foundation of comedy is to make yourself relatable to the audience. What made Trevor Noah so relatable was his ability to belong to different groups through his races, languages, cultures, religion, and lifestyles. To an outsiders perspective, many of his childhood stories may seem unrelatable and over-exaggerated, but throughout the book, Noah showed that in reality, many people had gone through his life experiences and it wasnt as uncommon as one might think. Although Noah could have been successful at comedy in South Africa even if he wasnt a bi-racial man who spoke a multitude of languages, his race and language skills unquestionably helped his success in comedy in a way that cannot be replicated. 
	Trevor Noah was born mixed; his father was a white Swiss man while his mother was a native South African. During apartheid in South Africa, it was illegal for a black person and a white person to have a child together. Despite this, Trevor was born. He knew his existence was illegal from a young age but it was only when he got older that he realized that there were others like him. After he became an established comedian and started traveling around the world for shows, he met other mixed South Africans all the time (30).  Your life experiences define who you are, and by extension, your humor and what you find funny.  Much of his childhood would have been extremely similar to the childhoods of other mixed South Africans who grew up during apartheid and they might have found the same things about Trevors childhood that he included in his comedy more humorous than someone who didnt go through some of the same experiences. 
	Not only was Trevors mixed race able to allow him to connect with other mixed people, he learned numerous languages through the course of his life. Language is power as communication is a human instinct. Humans crave connection with other humans and one way to do that is through communication, which is easiest when the same language is spoken. Trevor learned early on that the quickest way to bridge the race gap was through language, and he used that mentality throughout his life (54). Race is easy to overlook if some other characteristic, such as language, makes it easy to accept the similarities. He could fit in anywhere as long as he spoke their language. One of the first languages he learned to speak was English, which would have been, and probably still is, the most important and useful language in his arsenal. In South Africa, English is the language of money (54). As a comedian, English reaches out to one of the biggest comedy audiences in the world, not only to primarily English-speaking countries such as the United States and Great Britain, but also countries and people for whom learning English was also a necessity, a requirement for success in life. A part of what makes Trevors comedy so funny and appealing is his use of different languages and accents. Everytime Trevor speaks another different language in his comedy, he is able to open himself up to another group of people who might relate to his comedy and find it humorous. 
	Not only was Trevor born mixed, he also used that as the basis of his comedy. He essentially spoke out about a crime that was the reason why he was born, and a large part of his identity. A number of his fellow mixed South Africans can relate to that. Trevor spoke out about, and poured humor into, the story of when his mom was shot and the justice system allowed the offender to go free. Though to a privileged white person living in a first-world country, this might have seemed over-exaggerated and even fabricated. To a South African, or any person living in a third-world country, this story would have seemed relatable and even might have happened to their family or friends. The fact that Trevor used humor to tell such a horrific story shows others that its okay for humor to be a coping mechanism for traumatic events. 
	
	Comedy is a form of entertainment, but also a way for a comedian to connect with people and reach a large number of people through his words. Trevor's power to be a chameleon greatly influences his skill and success as a comedian. Without his fluidity across racial and cultural groups, his comedic audience would have been more restricted. Those that are able to relate to him and his humor would have been limited. Instead, Trevor can use his unique style of humor, apply it to his fascinating life, and watch the number of people he touches grow. 
?War On Writing Prompt
You've learned about some aspects of the War on Terror. You have studied your own war extensively. Now I want you to write 500 or so words about how you understand the impacting of framing something as a "war on", how you understand each conflict, and what connections you see. Specific examples are important. The main goal here is for you to show your ability to talk about framing, connections, and discussing nuance. 
Here is something to consider. Wars are waged with a goal in mind. Why are these wars being fought? Who benefits from having violence or disagreement framed as a war? With the War on Terror, there is now a never ending conflict that justifies the use of executive power. That power will exist as long as the war does. All of these wars are impossible to end as there is no victory. Consider how your wars can fit into this framework. 
The war on framing is used to force people into partisanships, because if you are not fighting for one side you are fighting for the other. Studying journalism led me to understand that the framing was used as a tactic to brew hatred, turmoil, and conflict. The war on journalism is not a war by any definition, but it is framed that way so people are forced to be for or against journalism. It is also framed that way to portray people in the other understanding as the enemy and as people to be attacked before they can attack. The war on journalism manifests in laws, police violence, and attacks by private citizens. It is not an armed conflict between two large groups, but that is what the framework works to create. By pushing people into groups and instilling fear in them from the connotations of war, the framing is able to pit people against each other and turn a conflict into a pseudo war carried out by individuals and legislature rather than armies. The war on terror was carried out as a series of by definition wars, but it also inspired the intense fear and islamophobia that America fosters to this day. It justifies the use of executive power, but it was not originally meant to be a war on middleeastern people, but the extremists that happened to be extremists in a religion centered in the middleeast. The government initially tried to differentiate the two, but you cannot separate peoples fears from the people who perpetrated them, nor can you separate the perpetrators from others that share their surface traits. However, with the fact that the war on terror was carried out as a series of wars in mind, it is still against a concept rather than another nation or state or people, and it is unending. By their definitions, wars can come to an end, but because these conflicts are not wars, just framed as such, they are unending and provide eternal justifications. The war on terror justifies executive action, the war on journalism justifies harassment of those you disagree with, the war on science justifies disagreement with facts, etc.. All these wars also disproportionately affect people of lower classes with fewer resources. The war on poverty, similar to how the war on journalism turned into a war on journalists, turned into a war on poor people. The war on the environment is a war on poor people on both sides. For those who are against environmental conservation, people in poor coastal communities sink, people in poor towns face drought, and the lacking infrastructure in poorer towns/states/countries cannot compensate for the environmental and atmospheric disasters, so they are destroyed. On the other side, poorer people who cannot afford the more expensive, environmentally friendly options are criticized rather than offered financial support so they can participate in conservation. Poorer countries are also expected to make swift changes to green energy when they dont have the infrastructure in place to make that switch like richer countries do. The war on education is also disproportionately affecting poor people because rich people will have access to good education no matter what, they can transport themselves, they can take the time to go to school, they can get education wherever they are, whereas poor people cannot. The war on drugs was to arrest minorities, groups that tend to make less money than majorities. The war on framework is often used to hide the agenda of a war on poor people because it distracts people by playing to their immediate fear response. ?Intro

But here's the seemingly ubiquitous conundrum that accompanies education: education is influenced by the norms of the community. But societies never exist in true equity, and this in turn, makes education an inequitable process.

However, throughout the history of a country, the pendulum will swing back and forth, progressing and regressing both the quality of and access to education.

(Have the word education on screen and add the flags of the countries as they are said)
Lets peer into how discrimination and inequity have presented themselves in education for youth in Cambodia, Afghanistan and the United States.

(continue from 10-20 seconds of video above while speaking)
The Boston busing desegregation crisis took place in the United States as the result of continued segregation in schools, and lack of funding and resources for black youth.
--
This crisis was a stark display of white rage towards a change in both education and societal norms.
https://www.archivespublichistory.org/?tag=racial-imbalance-act
Segregation within schools was deemed illegal by the Racial Imbalance Act put into law in 1965 which said that racial segregation was present and deteriorated quality of education.

However, school Committee members denied implementing the act as at the time, only 63% of Americans supported integration.

9 years later, in 1974, a Judge tried to enforce desegregation by having black students ride on buses to white schools and white students ride on buses to black schools.

They wrote slurs in the places black students occupied, threw bricks and eggs at black children, intimidated them, and took physical violence against them.

(Based on time maybe make this a title/caption about the photo while the video plays) This picture titled The Soiling of Old Glory came to be an iconic image in American history, showing a white teenager using the American flag like a sword to assault a black man. This photo was taken during the Boston busing desegregation crisis and shows the physical resistance to integration in schools and fear of not treating black people as inferior.

Afghanistan, a thriving and bustling country. In 1978, the year before the Soviets moved into Afghanistan, the countrys education system was improving. Despite Afghanistans history of inequality in education between girls and boys, that gap was growing smaller. 1 million children were going to school, and of those 1 million, hundreds of thousands of them were girls. At Kabul University, females made up 60% of the teachers and 40% of the doctors
1979, the year the Soviet army marched into Afghanistan. They would be there for 10 years.
This would be a time of discrimination and inequality. In this period of war and occupation, education under the Soviet Union was shaky.
The Soviets tried to indoctrinate the Afghan people both politically and culturally, teaching them their Communist ideologies.
However, many opportunities were created for the Afghan people, including scholarships for students and the teaching of skills to Afghan workers.
It was only till 1989 that the true destruction of Afghanistans education system was revealed. Hundreds of schools had been destroyed or used as bunkers.
There was a shortage of both schools and teachers as those who had opposed the government had either fled or been killed.

School shootings are a recently new phenomenon. Talk to students today, and theyll recite the procedure to a school shooter lockdown-- something their parents cant imitate.

--
(Put the following statistics on the screen over the newspapers above)
Since Columbine in 1999, there have been 231 school shootings and greater than 256,000 students have been exposed to gun violence in their schools. So why has this been allowed to occur?

--
As debate about gun control continues to intensify in past decades, there is another issue which needs addressing the lack of school psychologists and support systems for youth.
--
All of the common causes for students to turn to violence can be addressed through a trained and professional school psychologist (list common causes on screen: school shooters may have suffered childhood abuse and trauma, have a lack of coping skills, feel outcasted or ostracized, or have low self esteem. Theyre always students in crisis whose anger manifests into violence).
On average, there is 1 psychologist per 2,000 students and a recommended number is 1 per 400-500.

Additionally, the environment of the school plays a huge role in communication between faculty and students which dictates if an intervention for a school shooter will happen before it takes place. Only 50% of students said theyd tell an adult if they knew about a possible school shooting.

Video of Afghanistan under Taliban Rule: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErUZsZv9AAM 5:36 - 5:50
(Continue video until I finish speaking this part)
The Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic militia, took over the country in 1996 by killing the president and establishing themselves as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
Many of the Taliban fighters had grown up in orphanages and been educated in Islamic schools, something that was represented in the way they handled education during their reign.
Most of the oppression under their rule happened to females. Immediately after the takeover, the Taliban halted education for girls. Throughout the entire period, less than 3% of girls received some form of primary education.
All girls schools were closed down by the Taliban. Many teachers fled the country.
This was a period of violence in schools.
Many schools were raided or bombed and female students who continued to go to school and learn were targeted by the Taliban.
When the Taliban finally left in 2001, only 1 million children nationwide were attending school.

Individuals With Disabilities Education Act
The implementation of inclusivity acts in the United states saw a progression in the fight for equitable education.

https://quotesgram.com/title-ix-quotes/
One of which, Title IX, was a federal civil rights law put into action in 1972. This law prohibits discrimnation on the basis of sex in schools which use money supplied by the federal govenrment. This includes listening to and resolving cases involving sexual harassment and assualt, and prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Betsy Devos, former US secretary of education, under Trumps administration, set in place regulations on managing sexual harassment, making it nearly impossible for victims to be heard.

-
http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2019062100
This was done by redefining sexual harassment till the point nearly no case could pass the definition, and by placing the redefined rule within a 2,033 page document making it extremely difficult for people trained on sexual violence on campuses to understand the complexity of the revision.
The current Education Administration is revising the Title IX rollbacks and debating on what discrimination truly means.

--
Many states have introduced legislation that will ban transgender students from particpating in sports. But will the federal government enforce a new interpretation of title IX for all schools?
While the addition of inclusivity acts gave a voice to some wronged by our educational system, people are starting to peer into what true inclusivity looks like. And as we attempt to progress forward, there will always seems to be large back swings and periods of explicit inequity and discrimination.
Cambodia Progression Editing Materials
The period from 2001-2021 was a time of progression for Afghanistan. Both the schools and the education system were rebuilt. By 2003, over 4 million children, 1 million of whom were girls, were getting an education at one of over 7,000 schools nationwide.
At the beginning of this period, only around 15% of women were literate. That number rose to 30% in 2018.
By 2013, the number of schools had risen to 16,000 with 10.5 million students. The number of primary school students had risen by 6 million in only 9 years. Statistics showed an upward trend in education. Hope was rising.

In present day, USA as always peers into inequities in the education system. All of the issues 50 years ago have yet to be resolved. Segregation is still pervasive in the terms of districting and high income vs low income communities.

https://edtrust.org/the-equity-line/students-color-face-steep-school-funding-gaps/
Affluent neighborhoods fund their school districts meaning more money and resources for the students attending school. Additionally, racial minorities are historically underserved and grouped into districts. Meaning that segregation in education based on wealth disproportionately affects minorities (black people) and serves the privileged (white).

Additionally, inclusivity in schools is continuously being debated. Hb 3979, a Texas law passed in may this year, limits how a teacher can teach contentious issues.

(continue video imagery while talking)
An example is a teacher cannot say that the United States was built on slavery or talk about other race pertinent issues, and must keep students who engage in political advocacy from getting recognition and awards for their work. It also encourages for events to be considered from multiple and opposing perspectives. A texas administrator said this should include the holocaust.

2021 Afghanistan Female Students:
2021. The Taliban has successfully taken over Afghanistan. The US? Gone. The future? Uncertain.
Classrooms are gender segregated with male teachers teaching boys and female teachers teaching girls. This is a major problem because there is a shortage of teachers for girls since the majority of teachers are male. Education, especially for girls, is looking bleak.
However, there is still hope for Afghanistan.
Activists around the world, like the famous Malala, have been working to make education more equal for girls
and make education accessible for all.
Ending
All around the world, children are seen as symbols of hope, hope that the next generation will do better. Schools are seen as peaceful and intellectual locations.
The education of children has been handled very differently across the three countries we explored today. Even throughout history, education has faced periods of turmoil and violence, then peace and progression, then regression again.
The future is in the hands of the children, and how we educate these children, and what principles we teach them to follow, will make or break the future.

On Crime

History has progressed only through paving roads with blood. The lawgivers and
society toward the New Jerusalem3 be moral criminals? How can bloodshed and progress be intrinsically linked? The explanation requires a reevaluation of the

This
ancients, continuing with Lycurgus, the Solons, Mohammeds, Napoleons, and so forth1 permanently altered the course of mankinds development, introducing new laws to all of humanity. Such people are celebrated, put on a pedestal, and worshipped by humanity as benefactors of mankind. And yet, it is important to note that the majority of these people only succeeded in bringing about a new order through violence.
In fact, these people were particularly horrible shedders of blood.2 Indeed, under the lens through which we believe God judges society, the very actions that deliver the common good to mankind are the greatest of sins.
However, how can those that advance

Mans relationship with God is not uniform, but rather corresponds to the two general categories into which all of humanity is divided: the extraordinary and the ordinary. The former category consists of trailblazers capable of introducing a new word4 to society. These extraordinary people can, in a sense, become God. By this, I mean that such extraordinary people may overstep moral laws if they deem it just and necessary to make their	discoveries known to man.5 In other words, these extraordinary men have the right to establish and follow their own moral code: their own religion. Such men are not inferior to God; they are not made of flesh and blood, but of bronze.6 When such men shed blood, it is not a moral crime
sorrow in this world.7 In	this	way, extraordinary men are like Christ, suffering to raise not Lazarus, but a new word from the ground.
By contrast, those who fit	into		 the				ordinary category							are					not permitted					to				overstep moral laws as they are incapable			of				shedding blood			that						 would refresh			 society				 and usher		 in					a			new		age. Ordinary					 persons			 are unified by one defining characteristic:									the psychological					 illness that		consumes			them when		they			commit	a crime.				The						illness replaces															 ones willpower					 and	reason with					phenomenal childish thoughtlessness8 and thus  prevents  the ordinary  man  from cleanly  executing  a crime. This illness is the root of why the ordinary mans crime is so  conspicuous,  so easily  discovered.9 This illness develop[s] gradually,
illness is guilt, a manifestation of the friction between ones nature and ones actions. For the extraordinary man, an act of crime is in line with his nature, and thus no such guilt infects him. However, for the ordinary man, an act of crime contradicts his nature, and thus guilt arises within him. This guilt is natures punishment for those who step out of line from the destiny God ordained. There is no need to prosecute such persons as theyll beat themselves up because theyre so well-behaved.11 This is the law of nature and it enforces the natural order, a society in which people who are conservative,
well-behaved,    and
obedient by nature serve to preserve the world and increase its population12 while those who instinctively break the law13 serve to [destroy] the present order in the name of something better.14

Romanovich Raskolnikov,		divides humanity		into			two categories,								the extraordinary and the ordinary,	and		then proceeds to explain the relationships	between God and each of these categories of people. He writes						that
extraordinary persons may play the role of God and transgress moral laws in the name of the greater good, while ordinary persons, those inferior to God, are obligated to be obedient. This division of humanity, however, is not what consumed my interest. No rather, as the examining magistrate, it was indeed Raskolnikovs words about the psychology of the ordinary criminal - the illness that accompanies an ordinary mans crime - that interested me the most. In fact, I must admit, that it was using this theory of psychological illness to analyze the author himself that provided me with the most excitement.
It	seems		entirely possible,	if		not probable, that our own dear		author,	Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, wrote On Crime with an ulterior
possible				that							in composing				this				 very article, our author was attempting					to			prove that	 he						was					an extraordinary					man uttering		some					new word?16	 After					 all, who	among		us			 in Holy		Rus					doesnt consider		himself				a Napoleon										these days.17
And yet, in writing his article, Raskolnikov seems to have undermined the very goal that he tried to achieve with his piece. In convincing himself that	he	is
extraordinary and above everyone else, Raskolnikov isolated himself.	Without anywhere to go, without any palpable external goal, our dear author had no choice but to retreat within himself, behind the corners of his mind. And it was this fact that his faith laid only within himself that made him utterly incapable of standing among		the
extraordinary, for how can our author be a benefactor of mankind if he only considers himself  only suffers for himself and no other?
But our authors isolation pronounced him ordinary in yet
walls of his mind, Raskolnikov ruminated on his theory until thinking became too excruciating. He laid in his very own coffin and rather than living like a Napoleon, he pondered what a Napoleon would do Ironically, by asking himself this question, our	author
demonstrates							his unextraordinary nature.			A	Napoleon does not think about what an extraordinary person	would		do	but rather		acts				as			an extraordinary					person without					thought. Indeed, become a sun and everyone will see you18 and note that one	cannot	 become by		[philosophizing] too cleverly.19
Let me now state that the purpose of my article is not to condemn our author or name him utterly useless. Rather, I believe that, though twisted, the article shines as evidence of a promising	and intelligent individual; I do appreciate that first, ardent, youthful literary effort.20 But this proud, suppressed enthusiasm		is dangerous in youth!21 as most youths are not above the law or above

Some questions/topics to consider/get you started:
How does programmed cell death work?
What are the cancer and/or other connections?
Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death. It is used during early development to eliminate unwanted cells; for example, those between the fingers of a developing hand. In adults, apoptosis is used to rid the body of cells that have been damaged beyond repair. Apoptosis also plays a role in preventing cancer. National Human Genome Research Institute
apoptosis refers to a process of what's called programmed cell death where the cell is actually in a funny kind of way committing suicide. National Human Genome Research Institute
1. Programmed cell death is as needed for proper development as mitosis is.
Examples:
The resorption of the tadpole tail at the time of its metamorphosis into a frog occurs by apoptosis.
The formation of the fingers and toes of the fetus requires the removal, by apoptosis, of the tissue between them.
The sloughing off of the inner lining of the uterus (the endometrium) at the start of menstruation occurs by apoptosis.
The formation of the proper connections (synapses) between neurons in the brain requires that surplus cells be eliminated by apoptosis.
The elimination of T cells that might otherwise mount an autoimmune attack on the body occurs by apoptosis.
During the pupal stage of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, most of the cells of the larva die by apoptosis thus providing the nutrients for the development of the structures of the adult.
2. Programmed cell death is needed to destroy cells that represent a threat to the integrity of the organism.
Examples:
Cells infected with viruses
Cells of the immune system
Cells with DNA damage
Cancer cells
-LibreTextsBiology
In adult tissues, cell death exactly balances cell division. If this were not so, the tissue would grow or shrink. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26873/#:~:text=If%20cells%20are%20no%20longer,as%20leaves%20from%20a%20tree). 
By contrast, a cell that undergoes apoptosis dies neatly, without damaging its neighbors. The cell shrinks and condenses. The cytoskeleton collapses, the nuclear envelope disassembles, and the nuclear DNA breaks up into fragments. Most importantly, the cell surface is altered, displaying properties that cause the dying cell to be rapidly phagocytosed, either by a neighboring cell or by a macrophage (a specialized phagocytic cell, discussed in Chapter 24), before any leakage of its contents occurs. This not only avoids the damaging consequences of cell necrosis but also allows the organic components of the dead cell to be recycled by the cell that ingests it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26873/#:~:text=If%20cells%20are%20no%20longer,as%20leaves%20from%20a%20tree). 
Cell Bible: 1115 - 1129
Why does apoptosis occur?
-Eliminate unwanted cells, ex. development of digits during embryonic development or apoptosis in a tadpoles tail as it changes to a frog
-Quality-control: eliminate cells that are abnormal, misplaced, non-functional, or potentially dangerous
-Balance of cell division and cell death in tissue that is neither growing nor shrinking(the control mechanisms for the balance are unknown)
-Maintain a ready supply of short lived cells like neutrophils cells (type of white blood cells in human bone marrow), so they are ready if needed
-Animal cells recognizing damage damage to their organelles and killing themsleves
-Important example: DNA damage which can produce cancer causing mutations, if the cell cant repair the damage, they undergo apoptosis
Executioner caspases:
-Cleave and activate other executioner caspases
-Cleave target protiens such as
-Nuclear lamins, which cases the irreversible breakdown of the nuclear lamina(a structural network thats part of the nuclear envelope)
-A protein that holds a DNA-degrading enzyme in an inactive state, freeing the endonuclease to cut up the DNA in the nucleus
-Parts of cytoskeleton and proteins involved in attaching cells to their neighboring cells, this helps the apoptotic cell round up and detach from its neighbors, getting ready to be engulfed
Pearson Textbook: Chapter 16.1, only a small section though, look up apoptosis for other sections
Apoptosis caused by Internal signals:
Triggered by cell damage. 
1.Protein bax inhibits the protein bcl-12 on the surface of the mitochondria. Bcl-12 is related to inhibiting apoptosis
2.Bax also punches holes in the cell membrane and causes cytochrome-c to escape into the cytoplasm
3.The released cytochrome-c then binds to a protein called apaf-1(apoptotic protease activating factor-1)
4.Using the energy provided by ATP, these complexes aggregate to form apoptosomes. The apoptosomes bind to and activate caspase-9. Caspase-9 is one of a family of over a dozen caspases. They are all proteases. They get their name because they cleave proteins  mostly each other  at aspartic acid (Asp) residues.
5.Caspase-9 cleaves and, in so doing, activates other caspases (caspase-3 and -7).
6.The activation of these "executioner" caspases creates an expanding cascade of proteolytic activity (rather like that in blood clotting and complement activation) which leads to
a.digestion of structural proteins in the cytoplasm,
b.degradation of chromosomal DNA
c.phagocytosis of the cell
-LibreTextsBiology
This pathway is activated by a vast array of cellular stresses, including growth factor deprivation, cytoskeletal disruption, DNA damage, accumulation of unfolded proteins, hypoxia, and many others. It can also be activated by developmental signals that instruct cells to die, such as hormones -Cold Spring Harbor Labs
Apoptosis caused by external signalsEx. T-cells causing an infected cell to commit suicide
1.Fas and the TNF receptor are integral membrane proteins with their receptor domains exposed at the surface of the cell
2.Binding of the complementary death activator (FasL and TNF respectively) transmits a signal to the cytoplasm that leads to the activation of caspase 8
3.Caspase 8 (like caspase 9) initiates a cascade of caspase activation leading to phagocytosis of the cell.
4.Example: When cytotoxic T cells recognize (bind to) their target,
a.They produce more FasL at their surface.
b.This binds with the Fas on the surface of the target cell leading to its death by apoptosis.
Even cancer cells produced without the participation of viruses may have tricks to avoid apoptosis.
Some B-cell leukemias and lymphomas express high levels of Bcl-2, thus blocking apoptotic signals they may receive. The high levels result from a translocation of the BCL-2 gene into an enhancer region for antibody production.
Melanoma (the most dangerous type of skin cancer) cells avoid apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of the gene encoding Apaf-1.
Some cancer cells, especially lung and colon cancer cells, secrete elevated levels of a soluble "decoy" molecule that binds to FasL, plugging it up so it cannot bind Fas. Thus, cytotoxic T cells (CTL) cannot kill the cancer cells by the mechanism shown above.
Other cancer cells express high levels of FasL, and can kill any cytotoxic T cells (CTL) that try to kill them because CTL also express Fas (but are protected from their own FasL).
-LibreTextsBiology
An extracellular cue called a ligand will bind to the death receptors(Part of Tumor Necrosis Factor superfamily) on the membrane of the cell. Examples of death receptors are the TNF receptor-1, Fas/ CD95/ APO-1, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor-1 (TRAIL-R1; also called DR4), and TRAIL-R2 (also called DR5 in humans). Death receptor ligands include TNF, CD95-ligand (CD95-L; also called Fas-L), TRAIL (also called Apo2-L), and TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A). Binding a ligand to a death receptor will cause procaspase-8 to be recruited to the cytoplasmic tail in the cell, once it binds to a death domain on that tail, it becomes activated and starts the process of apoptosis, becoming caspase-8 -Cold Spring Harbor Labs
The outcome of DR-mediated activation of caspase-8 depends on the cell type. In so-called type I cells, caspase-8 initiates apoptosis directly by cleaving and thereby activating executioner caspases. In type II cells, caspase-8 must first activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (discussed below) to induce efficient cell death (Samraj et al. 2006). Type I and II cells differ in their content of intracellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which block executioner caspase function unless suppressed by proteins released from the mitochondria (Jost et al. 2009; Spencer et al. 2009). -Cold Spring Harbor Labs
Apoptosis without using a caspase
Neurons and maybe? Other cells have a protein called the apoptosis-inducing factor(AIF) inside of the mitochondria.
The cell will receive a signal causing AIF to be released from the membrane of the mitochondria, then binding to the DNA in the nucleus and killing the cell.
-LibreTextsBiology
Too little apoptosis
some diseases that stem from the inhibition of apoptosis(cancer) inhibit the process by inhibition of the FasL and Apof-1 proteins, or producing high levels of Bcl-2 and FasL to stop the apoptosis pathways from occurring
Too much apoptosis(and too little?)
Immune cells(lymphocytes) need to be removed from the body after an infection except for the memory cells. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune response cells (T/B cells) arent killed off after and infection and continue to proliferate, enlarge, and start attacking cells they arent supposed to.
How Caspases cause cell death:
Once the signal to create a caspase is caused in a cell, the caspase creation works as a positive feedback loop, making more and more caspases out of inert molecules around the cell, until the cell fully dies. This kind of a rolling surge, spurred by the activity of one or a few things, is known as a trigger wave -Stanford med
Caspases are classified by their roles in apoptosis and inflammation. Apoptosis caspases are (caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -9 in mammals) There are initiator caspases(8,9) and executioner caspases(3,6,7) 
Initiator caspases: the ones that get activated by either Apaf-1(caspase-9) or the death activator from the T-cells(caspase-8) both cause the trigger wave cascade to start. -Cold Spring Harbor Labs
Executioner caspases: Held inert normally due to their structure, but are activated when a specific site is cleaved by an initiator caspase, bringing the two activators in the structure together and allowing the executioner caspase to cleave the inhibitors of other executioner caspases. Also cleave various substrates, which causes contents harmful to the cell to be activated and released into the cytoplasm.
Caspase-9 and -8 mutations have been shown to be statistically significant in the proliferation of various types of cancer, with all of the mutations inactivating either caspase. Other mutations in both caspases have shown a decrease in cancer risk overall.
Caspase activity is a double-edged sword. Although defective caspase activation and the inadequate cell death that results can promote tumorigenesis, extreme caspase activation and the excessive cell death that ensues can promote neurodegenerative conditions. -Cold Spring Harbor Labs
Caspase-3 Essential for neuronal cell death; caspase-3 is an essential component in some apoptosis pathways, dependent on the stimulus and cell type; essential for the regulation of B-cell homeostasis -Cold Spring Harbor Labs
The main effector of DNA fragmentation in apoptosis. Accomplishes this by cleaving a substrate(DFF45/ICAD) to release an endonuclease(DFF40/ CAD) that causes the DNA fragmentation. Caspase-7 plays a secondary role in this specific cleavage process, backing up the effects of Caspase-3 -JBC
Caspase-6 Activated by caspase-3, degrades lamins(major architectural proteins of an animal cell nucleus) and activates procaspase-3, helping amplify the positive feedback loop/ trigger wave of apoptosis.-JBC
 Improper expression of caspase-6 is also involved in huntingtons disease and Alzheimers. Can be activated w/o caspase-3, and can also do autoactivation. Caspase-6 is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues (1721). In addition to being involved in apoptosis, caspase-6 is highly involved in axon pruning during development (2225) and in adult brains (26); pathological axonal degeneration (2729); and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD) -Activation and Regulation of Caspase-6 and Its Role in Neurodegenerative Diseases
High levels of casp-6 are found in brains with alzheimers, 
Apoptosis is crucial to embryonic development, causing limbs to form properly by deleting unneeded cells(webs between fingers), and deleting unneeded brian matter. The brain matter part is really important, an embryo with low or no Caspase-9/8 levels has a high chance of dying before being born.
Apoptosis vs. necrosis: 
-Generally, there are two ways in which a cell can die 
-They are killed by things that harm them (such as toxic chemicals or physical injury), a process called necrosis.
-They are triggered to undergo programmed cell death. The best-understood form of programmed cell death is apoptosis.
-Necrosis: 
-because the damaged cells plasma membrane can no longer control the passage of ions and water, the cell swells up, and its contents leak out through holes in the plasma membrane. This often causes inflammation in the tissue surrounding the dead cell.
-Apoptosis:
-Cells undergoing apoptosis first shrink and develop blebs, bubble-like protrusions, on their surface. 
-The DNA in the nucleus gets chopped up into small pieces, and some organelles of the cell, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, break down into fragments. 
-In the end, the entire cell splits up into small chunks, each neatly enclosed in a package of membrane.
-Such fragments release signals that attract debris-eating (phagocytic) immune cells, such as macrophages.
-the fragments of the dying cell display a lipid molecule called phosphatidylserine on their surface. Phosphatidylserine is usually hidden on the inside of the membrane, and when it is on the outside, it lets the phagocytes bind and "eat" the cell fragments.
Why do cells undergo apoptosis:
-Development: Some cells need to be deleted during development  for instance, to whittle an intricate structure like a hand out of a larger block of tissue.
-ex) fingers, loss of tadpoles tail, removal of unneeded neurons as neural circuits in the brain are wired.
-Viral infection/damage: Some cells are abnormal and could hurt the rest of the organism if they survive, such as cells with viral infections or DNA damage, or precancerous cells. 
-When a cells DNA is damaged, it will typically detect the damage and try to repair it. 
-If the damage is beyond repair, the cell will normally send itself into apoptosis, ensuring that it will not pass on its damaged DNA. 
-When cells have DNA damage but fail to undergo apoptosis, they may be on the road to cancer.
-Sometimes, pre-cancerous cells that have avoided internal apoptosis cues are detected by immune cells, which try to trigger apoptosis through an external signaling pathway. 
-EX) One example is the downregulation of p53, a tumour suppressor gene, which results in reduced apoptosis and enhanced tumour growth and development [1] and inactivation of p53, regardless of the mechanism, has been linked to many human cancers [24].  (https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-9966-30-87) 
-Temporary tasks: Cells in an adult organism may be eliminated to maintain balance  to make way for new cells or remove cells needed only for temporary tasks.
-Apoptosis also plays an essential role in the development and maintenance of a healthy immune system. 
-When B and T cells (immune cells that bind specific molecules) are first produced, theyre tested to see if they react against any of the bodys own self components. 
-Cells that do are eliminated right away by apoptosis. 
-If this process fails, self-reactive cells may be released into the body, where they can attack tissues and cause autoimmune conditions.
-And 
-When a pathogen is detected, the immune cells that recognize the pathogen divide extensively, undergoing a huge increase in numbers with the purpose of destroying the pathogen. 
-Once the pathogen is cleared from the body, the large numbers of pathogen-specific immune cells are no longer needed and must be removed by apoptosis to maintain homeostasis (balance) in the immune system.
Apoptosis and Autoimmune Diseases: https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/t-cells--b-cells-and-the-immune-system.h00-159465579.html 
-Our immune system is very powerful, but its also very regulated. Its designed to prevent from attacking normal tissue. Without these features, the immune system malfunctions, can damage normal tissue and lead to autoimmune diseases. But, unfortunately, these safety mechanisms sometimes allow cancer to avoid destruction by the immune system.
Regulation of B Cell and T Cell Development: 
-Both T- and B-lymphocytes undergo developmental stages and appear to share many regulatory mechanisms. 
-For example, the early survival of lymphocyte precursors is mediated primarily by cytokines, which both regulate the numbers of progenitors and play critical roles in initiating the rearrangement of the antigen receptor genes.
-Developing lymphocytes must create unique antigen receptors by rearrangement to generate the incredible diversity characteristic of an adaptive immune response.
- A consequence of the random nature of this process is that only 1/3 of rearrangements are joined appropriately and give rise to a functional antigen receptor.
-Although several mechanisms (i.e. use of alternative antigen receptor gene loci and receptor editing) exist to allow further opportunities for successful rearrangement, the majority of lymphocytes fail to generate functional antigen receptors and are thus eliminated by programmed cell death.
-T-lymphocyte progenitors that express a functional receptor are further subjected to both positive and negative selection to ensure that a functional receptor exists while eliminating those cells with self-reactive antigen receptors, which could be dangerous due to the potential for autoimmunity (Figure 3).30 
-When the avidity of interaction of the TCR and endogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is low, T-cell progenitors fail to be positively selected and undergo apoptosis. Conversely, in self-reactive T-cells, the avidity between the TCR and MHC is too high; such T-cells are eliminated by negative selection. 
-
Aka 
-Early development (double negative (DN)1 and DN2 stages) are dependent on cytokine signaling to mediate the survival and differentiation. 
-Pre-TCR signaling promotes survival and differentiation to the double positive (DP) stage in which the functional TCR is tested for recognition of self-MHC molecules in a process known as positive selection. 
-Those DP cells that express TCRs with specificities that react too strongly to self-MHC are induced to die by negative selection. 
-Those that have been positively selected downregulate either CD4 or CD8 and become mature single positive (SP) T-cells that are competent to leave the thymus and enter the periphery

LEGAL RESPONSE
The constitutional guarantee of equal protection in this case means that the Respondent, Harvard may consider a variety of admissions criteria, including race to promote a diverse student body. In crafting its admissions policies, Harvard relied on well-established Supreme Court precedent. Although the SFFA established standing to challenge Harvards policies, SFFA has failed to provide a constitutionally sufficient reason to overturn decades of precedent to eliminate any consideration of race as an admissions factor.
The process a student goes through to apply to Harvard is based on multiple standings, academic excellence, personality, race, and rigor; all of which are used to determine the likelihood of someone getting into the institution. As Harvard only accepts students with academic excellence, the other factors that come into play create a class of unique people with different life experiences and challenges, as well as culture. This policy may mean that people of other races are sometimes accepted into Harvard over Asian applicants, who account for 80 percent of the applicant pool. The institution should not be barred from any means of effectively diversifying admissions, as this benefits all parties involved. To fail at diversification would have significant effects for all colleges and universities and applicants who are applying. If race was not to be used as one of many criteria for admissions, it would mean barring more minority groups from being able to show their full potential and fair representation at Harvard.
STATEMENT OF CASE
Harvard is one of the most competitive universities in the world, with incredibly high admissions standards.
Students applying to Harvard University are expected to not only be at the top of their class academically, but also have profound work/ community engagement and sports history. While reviewing applications, Harvard University looks at all aspects of a students profile to make the admissions decision. This is done by ranking applicants based on various criteria on a 5-point scale and then voting on the application as a whole to make the decision. Harvard has chosen, along with many other institutions, to consider race in admissions for the primary reason of providing a more diverse student body and allowing more educational opportunities for a
wider spectrum of students. The Students For Fair Admissions have sued Harvard with the accusation that the universities admissions standards are racist against asian applicants, and in doing so accuse the affirmative action that the university uses as being a violation of Title VI of 1964 Civil Rights act and the 14th amendment.
The voting process is done with a 40 person panel to ensure each application is thoroughly reviewed.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
In this case, the SFFA (Students For Fair Admission), seeks to dismantle over 40 years of precedent that allows colleges to use race as one of many factors in admissions decisions. Affirmative Action has been implemented into United States society as a whole because it helps to level the playing field for all citizens of the country, for example this includes being mindful of historical setbacks individuals may face and how this could affect their current standing.
Title VI of 1964 Civil Rights act ensures that individuals do not face discrimination from any program that receives Federal financial assistance. This undoubtedly applies to Harvard, as the university receives federal research funding, but it is clear that Harvards actions of using race as one of many factors in admission does not violate The Civil Rights act.
In our argument today, the respondents of Harvard v. Students for Fair Admissions, argue that Affirmative Action is not a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but in fact is furthering the intent of the Civil Rights Act. If one is to look at past cases there are numerous precedents that legalize affirmative action and agree with Harvard's position on this case. Over the last 40 years the court has repeatedly maintained the precedent and understood the importance of affirmative action. One can note the Supreme Court twice citing Harvards admission process as a model for how other universities should conduct admissions. It has become a way that universities can consider race as part of an application that is consistent and affirming of the Constitution and federal laws. One can first see this precedent being established in Regents of The University of
California v. Bakke (1978), when justices ruled that the using race as part of an admissions decision was aligned with the Constitution. This decision was again reaffirmed in the Grutter v. Bollinger (2003) case where the court held that the Equal Protection Clause under the 14th amendment did not prohibit the use of race in admissions decisions.
The reasoning in Grutter v. Bollinger is particularly significant in our case because they came to the conclusion that because the university has a highly individualized and rigorous review of each applicant, applicants would not receive an acceptance nor a rejection solely based on their race. This same logic can be reasonably applied to Harvard's admissions process, as they review applications holistically and do not make decisions based on one aspect of the application.
Additionally, it is in not only the courts best interest to maintain 40 years of legal precedent, but dismantling affirmative action in college admissions will have severe effects on the country as a whole and the equity of college admissions.
ARGUMENT
I.RACE CONSIDERATIONS IN ADMISSIONS IS NECESSARY TO BUILD A DIVERSE CLASS
1.Harvard has one goal in mind when choosing which applicants to admit out of its extraordinary applicant pool: create an exceptional class that is diverse on many dimensions. Harvard admissions knows that having a class filled with people that have overcome different types of adversity and that come from diverse backgrounds is extremely beneficial to everyone's educational experience. Race and ethnicity is just one factor of a person's identity but it can still be an indicator of certain obstacles that one might have faced and will face in the future.
In order for Harvard to deliver on its mission of providing its students with the best education possible, it is most equitable, for all applicants, to consider race amongst many factors. Out of over 60 thousand applicants, only 2000 were accepted. Over 8 thousand had a perfect GPA and
over 34 hundred applicants had perfect SAT math scores. There is an abundance of highly qualified applicants when it comes to academic rigor which is why, when choosing the elite of the elite, admissions must take into consideration other factors: extracurriculars, athletics, recommendations, leadership, essays, awards, alumni interviews and life experience. Race can play a role in bolstering the efficacy of these factors but it is never a deciding factor itself.
The effect that the consideration of race has on admissions does not disproportionately underserved the Asian-American applicant pool. Out of the 2019 admitted applicants, 24% were Asian-American and 40% were White (European American) if race considerations were to be removed, the Asian-American acceptance rate would have been slightly higher (27% from 24%) but the White acceptance rate would have seen an increase of over double the Asian rate (48% from 40%). Furthermore, with the removal of race considerations, the African-American acceptance rate is more than halved (6% from 14%) and the Hispanic acceptance rate also takes a substantial hit (9% from 14%). The Asian and European American demographics are correlated with higher household income and net worth, whereas the African-American and Hispanic demographics are correlated with corresponding lower financial statistics. Household income is already a barrier to entry for acquiring the competitive credentials to be considered for acceptance to a school as competitive as Harvard; removing race considerations would only exacerbate this disparity further.
2.The equal protection clause underneath the 14th amendment has historically been extremely important in the decisions of many cases. It has been used in cases involving the suspect class of race in cases such as Yick Wo
v. Hopkins where the clause was invoked to strike down the unequal enforcement of a laundromat permitting law. The equal protection clause has also come into play in two cases that were notoriously overturned: Korematsu and Hirabayashi. Both of these cases were decided in spite of consideration that the matter may deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
In matters not of race, the 14th amendment is still incredibly powerful, but it is not applied under strict scrutiny as it is in matters with the suspect class of race involved. In the case of San Antonio Independent School District v.
Rodriguez, the Supreme Court did not examine Texas' public education finance system under strict scrutiny because it was not a matter concerning race. They decided that since there is no explicit right to education in the Constitution and the equal protection clause doesnt necessarily protect people of lower economic status as a class, the funding scheme for the schools was ruled constitutional. Again, in the case of Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, another case decided using the 14th amendment but not concerning race. Murgia sues Massachusetts Board of Retirement because of a law that allowed uniformed officers to be retired at the age of 50 involuntarily regardless of physical or mental health.
This law was not put under strict scrutiny as it does not concern race and so it was decided that the law was constitutional because although it is not the most efficient means to keep a physically fit police force, it did pass the rational basis test and was deemed constitutional.
Clearly, the 14th amendment is extremely important when deciding on matters of discrimination. In matters involving race, such as the one at hand in Harvard's admission process, it is imperative that the policy at hand upholds an interest of the state while also being the most efficient means of doing so. Any unnecessary discrimination based on race is and should be decided as unconstitutional.
3.There is a long history of higher education institutions considering applicant's race in the admissions process for the purpose of promoting diversity. On June 28th, 1978, the case of University of California Regents v. Bakke was decided. The university had a special admissions program for its medical school in which 16 out of 100 applicants would be accepted under and the main requirements of this program were if the applicant is a racial minority or significantly financially disadvantaged; since this is a policy concerning race, and must be put under strict scrutiny, the main holding was that although The Medical School of the University of California at Davis special admissions program upheld a compelling interest to the state in the form of increasing academic diversity, a race quota of 16% was not the least restrictive means of doing so.
On June 23rd, 2003, the case of Grutter v. Bollinger was decided. The University of Michigan Law School admission policies were also held under strict scrutiny by the Supreme Court. The main difference between Grutter and Bakke is that, in Bakke, the admission policy had a race
quota while in Grutter the admission policy in question had no specific quota. The University of Michigan Law School admissions policy does consider race, but not as a deciding factor on its own; this was ruled to be constitutional and not in violation of the 14th amendment or Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The admission policy that includes race but not as a quota was ruled under strict scrutiny to uphold a compelling interest in the state while also being narrowly tailored enough to avoid undue harm to nonminority applicants.
Again on June 24th, 2013, another case involving race in admission policy was decided. In the case of Fisher
v. University of Texas, theyve had a policy of admitting all in-state applicants that are in the top 10% of their highschool class since 1997, they later revised this to also include race considerations for the other 90% of in-state applicants. The University of Texas was sued for this policy under claims that it violated the 14th amendment. The admission policy was held under strict scrutiny, and just like The University of Michigan's admission policy, since there is no quota, the policy passed strict scrutiny as it upholds state interest in providing a diverse learning environment while being narrowly tailored to do so.
Harvard's admissions process, with regards to how it incorporates race, is very similar to that of The University of Michigan and Texas in that it does not implore a strict race quota but does make use of race in the decision making process as one of many factors in order to create a learning space with higher diversity. Harvard's policy makes use of race solely to uphold the state's interest in a diverse learning experience while being narrowly tailored to have a minimum impact on the equity of admissions.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the court should affirm the precedents and Harvard Universitys admissions protocols.

Through observing humans and their behaviors, I have determined that humanity is divided into two classes: the extraordinary and the ordinary. Both of these classifications can help us understand an individuals contributions to society and the liberties -- or lack thereof -- that they may partake in. The role of an ordinary person is to participate in societys monotonous routine and adhere to social expectations. Whereas extraordinary individuals are innovators, people of the future[2] who make new and significant contributions to society. Because of their position, they have the right to impose upon others if the result is for the progress and well-being of society[3].
Regardless of your stance about how our society functions, it is quite apparent that there is a general understanding of an unspoken social contract that we adhere to. This is how society is able to flow and function properly -- that is, only if everyone participates. What truly defines the two subdivisions: Is one's capacity or incapacity to transcend this social contract. Those who are bound to this social contract are people of the ordinary category. The primary function of the ordinary is solely for the reproduction of the species[4]. Ordinary people can be generally identified as those who are: conservative by nature, well-behaved, who live in obedience and like being obedient (286). They experience no shame in this as they are obligated (286) to be obedient[5], for it is their destiny to interact with society in this way. On the other hand, those who are born as extraordinary, as I have defined previously, are born with a gift or a talent of uttering a new word in their milieu (286). This category consists of those who break the law, people who are disrupters, destroyers, and innovators[6]. The mere existence of extraordinary people violates the societal contract. Their predisposition grants them the right to crime; for example, think about the trailblazers of humanity[7], people like Newton and Kepler. If the only way for their discoveries to be made known to the world required the sacrifice of the lives of one, ten, a hundred, etc., then Newton or Kepler had the right to eliminate those people if it resulted in their discoveries being known to all of humanity[8]. You see, they were on the precipice of a discovery that would alter the lives of humanity. This potential discovery is what gave them the right to sacrifice all of those lives as long as it was for the benefit of the greater good[9]. This is not to say that all extraordinary people absolutely must commit these outrageous deeds or break the law[10], they simply have the right -- not the official right, but rather the right to permit his consciousness to overstep these obstacles[11]. If we look across history, the influential people of our past, beginning with the ancients, continuing with Lycurgus, the Solons, Mohammeds, Napoleons, and so forth (285), all of them are criminals. As I have discussed in previous publications, it is just by the virtue of the fact that in propagating new laws, they were at the same time destroying the old laws viewed as sacred by society and handed down by their fathers (285). 
Through much deliberation, I have determined that both of these classes are essential and possess the equal right to exist[12]. One class reproduces and keeps society functioning, and the other contributes to its progress. Although the rights of the extraordinary may be concerning to some people, the majority of humanity does not acknowledge their right to crime[13]. Our conservative systems punish and hang these men with absolute justification[14] and conviction that they are above the extraordinary. There is also the concern of one pretending to be the other. Many ordinary men will attempt to convince themselves and others that they are of the extraordinary[15], but it is impossible to transcend the line between the two. These men never get very far[16]. There are very few men born into the extraordinary and very few are capable of uttering something new so it is quite difficult to pose as the other. I am aware that these categories are quite arbitrary and can be divided into many subcategories[17], but this essential distinction between the extraordinary and ordinary is a result of a law of nature[18]. 
------------------------------------------------------------
[1] It consists precisely in the view that by the laws of nature, people are divided in general into two categories (286)
[2] The first category always comprises of men of the present; the second, men of the future (287).
[3] They require the destruction of the present order in the name of something better (286).
[4] The lower category (ordinary), that is, so to speak, material serving solely for the purpose of reproducing the species (286)
[5] In my opinion, theyre even obligated to be obedient because thats their destiny, and theres nothing humiliating about it for them (286)
[6] The second category consists of people who break the law, destroyers or, judging by their abilities, are predisposed to be so (286).
[7] I develop the idea in my article, that all people at least the lawgivers and trailblazers of humanity (285)
[8] if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could in no way have become known to people other than through [...] (285)
[9] They require the destruction of the present order in the name of something better (286).
[10] I dont insist in any way that extraordinary people absolutely must and are always obligated to commit all sorts of outrages (285)
[11] I merely imply that the extraordinary man has the right that is, not the official right, but he himself has the right to permit his conscience to overstep (285)
[12] Both have an equal right to exist (287)
[13] However, there is no cause for alarm: the mass of humanity hardly recognizes this right (286)
[14] It punishes these men or hangs them (more or less), and does so with absolute justification, fulfilling its conservative function (286)
[15] an extremely large number of them like to imagine themselves advanced people, destroyers, and aspire to utter a new word (288)
[16] you having nothing to worry about, because these people never get very far (288)
[17] Regarding my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I agree that its somewhat arbitrary, but Im not insisting on exact numbers (286).
[18] Only one thing is clear: the order that controls the human births, all these categories and subdivisions, must be extremely closely and accurately determined by some law of nature (288).The goings-on in St. Petersburg

VOL. 42	ST. PETERSBURG, TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1866
On Crime: The nature of the criminal mind
Greetings,	Periodical Discourses readers. I am a current philosopher, and recently studied law at St. Petersburg University. I am writing this article because after much thought and deliberate consideration, I have come to a conclusion about a topic that I believe may be of great importance to the general public, and that I have an obligation to share.
The idea that I have arrived upon regards the existence of and distinction between two groups of people, and each groups relationship with crime. It has taken all of my life so far to finally realize that there are two groups of people in the world: the ordinary, and the extraordinary.
This distinction is more fundamental than any aspects of a person's personality, their financial status or race; but rather a persons purpose. Ordinary people are, by definition, ordinary. This group of ordinary people are merely material serving solely for the purpose of reproducing the species.1 These people are incapable of generating any genuinely new ideas or concepts; all their ideas are just repetition of others. This group consists of conservative people by nature, well-behaved, who live in obedience and like being obedient. They arent humiliated or embarrassed by being obedient because this is simply their predestined fate.2 The laws and rules of society are created for this group of people to dutifully follow.
In stark contrast, there is a group of select individuals that stand out. I have chosen to call these people extraordinary. Extraordinary people serve a greater purpose in life, and as such are much more impactful than ordinary people. Because of this greater purpose, extraordinary people are permitted or even almost obligated in some cases to eliminate any obstacles that prevent them from achieving this purpose. They are
permitted to commit crimes as long as the crimes are for the greater good.
Since we can define crime as a new idea or a transgression of existing ideas and laws, the extraordinary people of the past were criminals, just by virtue of the fact that in propagating new laws, they were at the same time destroying the old laws viewed as sacred by society and handed down by their fathers.3 In a word, I conclude that everyone, not only the great people, but even those who stand out just slightly from the everyday rut, that is, those who are even marginally capable of uttering some new word, must, by their nature, necessarily be criminals.4
I acknowledge that this idea is revolutionary and may not entirely make sense initially, however to understand it fully we can examine past extraordinary	people. However, all we have to do is look at great historical figures of the past for confirmation of this idea.
For example, military leaders Napoleon Bonaparte and Julius Caesar. Both leaders committed numerous crimes to benefit their respective societies. To fully grasp the scope of extraordinary people, imagine for a moment that about ten people or so stood as obstacles to the dissemination of the incredible works and knowledge of Isaac Newton or Johannes Kepler. In this case, it would be perfectly just or even obligatory, for Kepler or Newton to eliminate these obstacles in any way necessary so that they could share their knowledge with the rest of humanity, for the betterment of humankind.
However, despite the fact that extraordinary people are permitted to step over the boundaries defined by law in order to benefit the greater good, there are limitations to this notion. This concept does not extend so far as to allow an extraordinary person such as Newton to rob and kill any person he chooses to.
I urge you to understand that while this concept may sound problematic, ordinary people must not inhibit in any way the aspirations and work of
the extraordinary folk. Restricting the autonomy of these individuals instead of leaving them unbound to pursue and fulfill their aspirations will have severe consequences. More than any benefit, far worse are the potential consequences that would arise from a lack of extraordinary	people, stagnation of society, and a lack of innovation. I leave the reader with this idea in the hope that they have learned something new, and understand better the ways of society.
Sincerely, R.R.
Special feature: porfiry petrovich
Greetings, readers and good citizens of St. Petersburg. For those who do not already know me, my name is Porfiry Petrovich, and I'm the examining magistrate at the St. Petersburg police station.
I am writing to you today about an intriguing paper I read recently. by a law student about the concept of the existence of superior members of society. While I admire the literary effort that went into crafting the article in question, and the content and ideas outlined in this article are fascinating, I disagree with these ideas,1 and consider it of great importance that I share the dangers of these ideas with the public. The material in the article in question has the potential to cause chaos in society, and I feel I must address this before it gets out of hand.
The article in question, titled On Crime, was recently published in Weekly Discourses. The article was submitted anonymously but I have reason to believe that the author is one Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, who incidentally the St. Petersburg Police Department is currently a suspect in the murder of Alyona and Lizaveta Ivanovna. The author of the paper, poses the idea that there are two types of people in the world, those who are ordinary and those who are extraordinary.
The ordinary person is one who simply serves as reproductive material to sustain the human race, while the extraordinary one serves a greater purpose in life, and is permitted to commit crimes if they help complete an end goal. The article has to do with the extraordinary category, and alarmingly, the author sanctions bloodshed as a matter of conscience,2 and claims the extraordinary people have a so-called right to crime.
Let us consider for a moment that there are indeed these two categories of people, as described in the article. The main issue I have with this notion is that the distinction between these two categories seems somewhat arbitrary. Apart from perspective gained in retrospect, there is no way to immediately distinguish an ordinary person from an extraordinary one. The question that concerns me is this: how does one distinguish the extraordinary people from the ordinary ones?.3 This may not sound like a serious issue, however the author states that extraordinary people are permitted - and in some cases obligated - to commit crimes for the greater good. The issue is the disaster that would happen if some confusion results and one of the ordinary category imagines that he belongs to the other one, and begins to eliminate all obstacles4 under the false impression that they were fulfilling some greater purpose.
Perhaps a potential solution is to provide a sort of special clothing or identifying mark for the extraordinary people to wear so that they can be differentiated from the ordinary people.
If this theory is correct, and there are extraordinary people, then this is concerning for society, because there are people who could simply overstep the rules sometimes under an erroneous impression that they are doing it for the greater good
This article begs the question, is it really a good idea to go through life assuming that you can harm other people for the greater good for a potentially unsubstantiated cause?
Sincerely,
Porfiry Petrovich
TRAGIC CARRIAGE ACCIDENT LEAVES 1 DEAD
		
Marmeladov died sunday evening, after being run over by a carriage.
It is with a heavy heart that I must announce the death of my husband, Semyn Zakhrovich Marmeladov. Two nights ago, Semyn was drinking as he often did. After attempting to cross the street, he fell underneath the wheels of a passing carriage that was drawn by two horses. He was critically injured, but passed away at our home, among family and friends.
I will be honest, I do not entirely resent his passing. Marmeladovs constant drinking used up much of the little money we managed to make, and dragged us farther down the path of poverty. He was rarely at home to be with the children, and when he was he was drunk and incoherent. He used what little money we did have on alcohol. At least this way our family will not lose as much money.1
While he didnt take care of our children and wasted away our meager earnings in taverns, and he split our family apart, he was a kind man, and did not do these things mean-spiritedly.
However, all this doesnt mean much now that he has passed, and we are left to try and find a new path in life.
Despite contributing to our family's hardship, we will miss him sometimes, and I hope that he has moved on to a more peaceful place.

OPINION
Dmtry Prokfich Razumkhin:
The income disparity gap is growing. Heres how you can help.
As a resident of St. Petersburg, I am deeply concerned by the increasing wealth disparity in our city. The impoverished residents of the city barely have enough food to eat or clothes to stay warm, while the wealthy enjoy a life of privilege and excess.
The issue is that the wealth disparity does not only affect the poor, but also the wealthy. Such a large wealth disparity means the poor struggle to find jobs. In fact, civil servant Marmeladovs fifteen year old daughter was forced to become a prostitute in order to help support the family. 1
Creating more opportunities for the poor, and helping them integrate into higher society has benefits for everyone, because it will help increase the economy of the city. As a society, we cannot afford to ignore this problem of income disparity any longer.
What can you do to help? We urge readers with money to spare to contribute to the St. Petersburg food bank, either by donating food items, clothing, or even financial donations.
In pursuit of a more just and equitable society, we must strive to lift one another up, and our city will be better for it.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO
THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT 
[Jan 23, 2023]
Justices Bulajewski, Hosein, Mollman, and Duplessis delivered the opinion of the court.
      Integral to the collective conscience of our nation is a right to the bodily autonomy and privacy of ones person. In this digital age, the internet and Artificial Intelligence raise a multitude of questions around the right to privacy online. Primarily, what information should reasonably be collected and at what level of detail. The petitioners claim that Clearview AIs actions are unconstitutional on the basis of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The respondent counters that the curtailing of their company would be in violation of the First Amendment, but we find that the rights of the people abridged by the operations of Clearview AI take precedence over the First Amendment rights of data collection. As seen in cases such as Citizens United and Katz, there is a model set that acknowledges the First Amendment rights of corporations while enforcing the idea that individuals have the right to privacy both inside and outside the home, as long as that privacy is seen as reasonable by society. In examining Clearview AIs practices around consent to use photographs for biometric data gathering and the process of deleting said photos, we find that respondent is in violation of the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
      Clearview AIs operations within the state of Illinois are in clear violation of the Biometric Information Privacy Act, or BIPA. This act expressly prohibits private entities from collecting biometric identifiers from persons without not only notifying the subject or a legally authorized representative of the fact that it is being collected, the purpose of this collection, length of time it will be stored and used, but also receiving written consent from the subject or legally authorized representative. 
   As such, Clearview AIs operations as an entity that collects said biometric identifiers from the internet without receiving consent or even notifying the subjects are directly in violation of BIPA. Clearview AIs technology uses facial geometry, or faceprints, to identify individual faces among a vast collection of photos from across the internet. BIPA explicitly defines a scan of hand or face geometry as a biometric identifier, rendering Clearview AIs operations and data collection to be explicitly in violation of Illinois state law.
      However, not only does Clearview AI violate BIPA, but it is in direct opposition of various Amendments within the Constitution. 
   Firstly, Clearview AIs technology has the potential to violate  the Fourteenth Amendment. While this specific occurrence has not been documented and brought to the court, where the injury threatened by an unconstitutional statute is present and real before the statute is to be effective, and will become irreparable if relief be postponed to that time, a suit to restrain future enforcement of that statute is not premature (Pierce v. Society of Sisters).
AI technology in general has a definitive history of racial bias. Examples of this include the accuracy of an AIs facial recognition technology being significantly less for a person of color than that of a white person, being more likely to misidentify the former than the latter. 
      Since Clearview AI is utilized by law enforcement across the country, false recognition could have potentially devastating effects on an individual who is falsely implicated in a crime. Since AIs facial recognition skills are more adept at distinguishing between white people, this would disproportionately affect people of color.
     The injury of being falsely implicated in a crime can reasonably and definitely be considered irreparable. As such, Clearview AIs operations are in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
      Although First Amendment rights extend to corporations (Citizens United v. FEC) , because Clearview AI is violating or is at risk of violating a multitude of rights for individuals, these rights must take precedence. 
    In terms of consent, the test outlined in Katz v. United States is most appropriate. Katz states that the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. [...] But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected (Katz v. United States). While images shared online are meant to be public, it is reasonable for a person to expect that their biometric data should be kept private. As seen in Katz, this expectation applies to images gathered in public spheres as well as in private spaces such as the home. Clearview AI must gain consent to use these images in their algorithm and by not doing so, are in violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
     We must then address the issue of Clearview AIs maintenance and deletion of photos. Returning to Katz, we find that a person must have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable (Katz v. United States). In the issue of removing photos that have been deleted from social media accounts, individuals have the expectation that those photos would be removed across databases and would expect privacy from those photos continuing to be used by third party companies. Likewise, society recognizes that this is a reasonable expectation of the act of deleting a photograph. 
       This reasoning applies to the privatization of accounts as well. Clearview AI does not collect photos from private accounts so it is reasonable for both individuals and society as a whole to expect that someone privatizing an account should expect the photos on that account to be removed from the public sphere and Clearview AI by extension.
    Clearview AI asserts that the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) infringes on the company's right to gather and distribute information beneath the First Amendment. In contrast, BIPA serves as a protective measure for the First Amendment rights of those subject to Clearview AIs intrusive faceprints. The act anticipates the consequences of a wide dissemination of biometric data by enacting that a private entity must, (1) informs the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative in writing that a biometric identifier or biometric information is being collected or stored; (2) informs the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative in writing of the specific purpose and length of term for which a biometric identifier or biometric information is being collected, stored, and used (BIPA, 740 ILCS 14/15). When a person is stripped of their anonymity, they no longer have the freedom to associate through participating in lawful activities, such as protests. Locations of gathering can be tracked through photos and subsequently converted to faceprints. BIPA does not prevent Clearview AI from collecting images. However, the act prevents the company from compositing images without the consent of the photographed. Thus, BIPA supports the First Amendment right of collecting data, yet not the companys practices which preclude an individuals control of their image and identity.
      Cases Reno v. ACLU, Silverman v. United States, and Kyllo v. United States elucidate how the First Amendment rights of the individual conforms to the advent of the internet and heightened use of technology. Reno recognizes the internets expanse and in conjunction with Silverman and Kyllo determines whether certain technology expands beyond what a human has the right to do within the bounds of the First Amendment. Respondent claims that a human can emulate the processes of Clearviews AI. Through their argument, Clearview hopes to bypass BIPA and claim their product is comparable to an image a human could collage and thus permissible.  
      This poses the question- what is the feasible limit of a humans capability to mimic a biometric identifier? A human can aggregate photographs. A human can access the vast stores of photos on the internet to use as they see fit. A human cannot reasonably construct an algorithm comprised of complex mathematical formulas and vectors at a scale similar to Clearview AIs algorithm. An algorithm that so intently relies on the facial geometry of an individual that in the process strips oneself of autonomy and anonymity. Clearview AIs product promises accuracy of facial matching from images pulled from the internet through its programming. Whether the company lives up to its claims of accuracy is inconclusive due to the fact that the percentage of false matches is confidential. However, the fact still remains that the purview of Clearview AIs reach extends beyond what an individual can create, and in the process intercedes with both the First and the Fourth Amendment. The technology at hand, Clearview AI, expands beyond the skillset of a human and thus is not subject to the same level of First Amendment scrutiny. It is true that a company can create something a human cannot, but not if the technology invades the privacy and sanctity of ones person (Fourth Amendment). 
      As extrapolated through the cases of Eisenstadt v. Baird, Myers v. United States, and Griswold v. Connecticut, every individual has an inextricable right to bodily autonomy and dignity through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Clearview AI threatens this security as in a world of faceprints, the sole way of maintaining privacy would be to cover ones face. However, an individual has a right to govern their own body as secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.       
      Clearview AI has stated that the effects of reversing this decision would devastate internet businesses. This does not hold up as Clearview AI can simply gain consent from individuals before using their photos and enact a deletion policy if they wish to continue operating. Other companies must follow suit, and adopting these practices will in no way severely destroy companies. This is the best judgment for both the integrity of the judicial system and the protection of this nations citizens. 
      Through collection of biometric data from the general public, Clearview AI is found to be in violation of not only Illinois state law, but also the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. The processes and operations of Clearview AI cannot be considered constitutional, and are unlawful. To allow Clearview AIs operations to continue would be to potentially jeopardize and fundamentally alter the very notion of privacy within the American way of life, while abridging the rights that are clearly provided within the Constitution. 
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is thus, reversed.

Tragedy Space: a Function Mapping Four Literary Dimensions to the Quality of a Tragedy
	A good tragedy is like a puzzle that the audience must solve, deriving pleasure by doing so. Aristotle claims that the exercise of any capacity is pleasurable. The practice of cognition, engages and satisfies the desire to exercise our distinctively human power of understanding, and is therefore pleasurable (Heath qtd. in Aristotle xiii). Aside from providing pleasure, the main goal of tragedy is to provide catharsis for the audience (Heath qtd. in Aristotle xxxvii). Catharsis is the purging of emotions like pity and fear via experiencing these emotions in the controlled environment of tragedy. The level of catharsis can be used as a proxy measurement for the quality of a tragedy. There exist at least five constants that are present in all Greek tragedies. A tragic plot must be complete: having a beginning, a middle, and an end. The actions within the plot must also be universal. Universality requires the chain of events to be plausible, ones that would be likely in any similar circumstance. According to Aristotle, universal plots contain, the kind of thing that would happen (Aristotle 16). The events in a plot must also be connected, equivalent to unified. Each event must induce the conditions for the next event to occur. Plots must also be complex, meaning that they must contain anagnorisis or peripeteia, which are the Greek terms for recognition and reversal respectively. Tragedy Space is a method for qualifying tragedies. Provided that a tragedy contains the baseline elements, the position of a story in Tragedy Space determines how cathartic and therefore tragic it is. The multi-dimensional Tragedy Space is not intended to be a visual tool. Instead, it provides a spatial framework for comparing four principal measurements of tragedy. The Tragedy Space is defined by the four following dimensions which each measure certain aspects of tragedy. First, the tragic hero has a moral alignment between wicked and virtuous, which will inform how the audience feels when the character experiences a change in fortune. Sometimes characters may have multiple changes in fate, so the Tragedy Space only concerns the ultimate peripeteia direction. Aristotle notes that a morally neutral character going to bad fortune is the most tragic combination (Aristotle 21). Conflictingly, from the introductory analysis of Poetics, a, moderately virtuous person, following the same reversal direction will provide the best tragic plot (Heath qtd. in Aristotle xxxiv). So the tragic hero may be more than morally neutral. Thus, only a slightly virtuous hero fits in the moral interstice between neutral and moderate virtue. Another discrete dimension factors in whether or not anagnorisis occurs before the actualizing of the tragic error, which is termed, hamartia action. Aristotle figures that recognition before the fatal act is best (Aristotle 23). The consequence of early recognition is that the fatal fall to bad fortune will be stopped. As summarized in the analysis of Poetics, The best kind [of tragic plot] is precisely one in which a change to bad fortune is imminent but does not occur (Heath qtd. in Aristotle xxxiv). The last dimension is concerned with the affected parties of the hamartia action. Tragedy is best when the hubris of a tragic hero harms those with whom the hero has a close relationship. The Greek term for these persons is, philoi, all those to whom one is bound by ties of mutual obligation (Heath qtd. in Aristotle xxxiii). These close bonds establish a greater emotional stake, augmenting any pity and therefore catharsis that the audience experiences. The tragedy of Oedipus the King has the optimal tragedy structure according to the dimensions of Tragedy Space.
Oedipus the King upholds all five constants of tragedy. The plot is complete because there exists a beginning and an end, and therefore a middle. First, Apollo prophesized to Jocasta and Laius that they would have a son who would wed his mother and kill his father. Last, Oedipus relinquishes the title of king to his brother-in-law, Creon, and leaves Thebes. All other events are in the middle. The plot is universal because Oedipus acts as one would expect a character in his situation would. With the understanding that Oedipus is oblivious to whom his parents are, his actions are seen as reasonable (Heath qtd. in Aristotle l). To exhaustively prove that the plot is entirely unified requires the examination of all its events. Instead, the focus will be set solely on the famine and plague that blights Thebes at the start of the story. This conflict is unified because, according to the ancient Greeks, corrupt rulers lead to a corrupted land. This concept is expressed in Poetics, In Greek religious thought, it was very dangerous for a city to harbor polluted persons; they could bring down disaster on the whole community (Heath qtd. in Aristotle li). Thus the conflict is motivated by the fact that the married king and queen are mother and son. The plot is complex as there is peripeteia, when the messenger informs Oedipus that his father was Liaus, which provides Oedipus with anagnorisis that he has fulfilled Apollos prophecy. The plot of Oedipus the King contains all five core elements of tragedy, and is therefore eligible to be measured in Tragedy Space.
In terms of the two dimensions of character virtue and peripeteia direction, Oedipus is moderately virtuous and ultimately experiences a change to bad fortune. Oedipus is perceived as extremely virtuous by his subjects. The priest that introduces Oedipus proclaims, You cannot equal the gods, [...] But we do rate you first of men (Sophocles 161). As the first of all men, Oedipus must be very virtuous. Yet, Oedipus also has hubris, believing that he holds the same power as the gods. He claims that he will grant his peoples prayers, You pray to the gods? Let me grant your prayers (Sophocles 171). Oedipus lack of humility diminishes his moral standing to merely being moderately virtuous. In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle defines virtue as good conduct that exists between extremes of behavior. Virtue [...] is defined as a mean between two extremes of excess and defect in regard to a feeling or action (Aristotles Ethics). In the case of confidence and pride, Oedipus excess hubris detracts from virtuousness. In addition, from the plot, it is self-evident that Oedipus peripeteia direction is going to bad fortune. The combination of a moderately virtuous hero falling to bad fortune places Oedipus the King in the most tragic location in the respective dimensions.
Oedipus has his anagnorisis as a result of the plots peripeteia, yet both of these events occur after the hamartia action. Oedipus does not realize that he has been following Apollos prophecy until after he slew his father and wedded his mother. Instead, the tragic heros anagnorisis is achieved during the peripeteia, when the messenger apprises Oedipus of the fact that, Polybus was nothing to [him] (Sophocles 218). Given that Polybus is not Oedipus father, Apollos prophecy may be true. Aristotle notes that the moment of peripeteia is most opportune when it coincides with reversal when he writes: Recognition is best when it occurs simultaneously with a reversal, like the one in the Oedipus (Aristotle 19). Aristotle also notes that anagnorisis is best when effectively unified and universalized, The best recognition of all is that which arises out of the actual course of events, where the emotional impact is achieved through events that are probable, as in Sophocles' Oedipus (Aristotle 27). The anagnorisis is effectively set up by the peripeteia. In this circumstance, even though the anagnorisis is unified and concurrent with peripeteia, it still takes place after the hamartia action. For this reason, the plot of Oedipus the King does not adhere to the most tragic form on the anagnorisis axis.
Oedipus hamartia action affects very close philoi. Oedipus harms his parents, a prime example of philos, through acts of incest and murder. In this case, Oedipus mother is also his spouse, another close philos. A messenger summarizes the potent dual philos by saying, [Jocasta] brought forth husband by her husband, children by her own child, an infamous double bond (Sophocles 236). Oedipuss anagnorisis of the truth about his mother is immediately followed by his nemesis. Oedipus also, as the last living parent, abandons his daughters. Children are a more intimate philoi than parents or spouses, so any harm that befalls them creates a more potent catharsis. The multifarious categories of afflicted philoi are the unique feature that makes Oedipus the King maximally tragic on the Tragedy Space dimension of familial harm.
The Tragedy Space is a function that takes a tragedys components as an input and returns the quality of a tragedy as an output. The definition of a mathematical function requires that any single input may only have one output. This applies to Tragedy Space, any plot will have one valuation of tragicness. When such a function as Tragedy Space is defined, its inverse can also be of use. One example is the inverse Hessian matrix, which is used in the Newton-Raphson iterative minimization method. Starting with the quality of a tragedy, Tragedy Space can inform an author about the necessary combination of features from each dimension required to construct a tragedy of the given quality or desired level of catharsis. The inverse of the properly-mapped Tragedy Space function is not injective, it allows for one quality of tragedy to map many different combinations of tragic elements. In practice, this means that an author who wishes to write a plot that provides a certain level of catharsis will have some choice in the mix of tragic elements that they must employ. Furthermore, when using the mathematical concept of space to interface with literature, the same tools available to the mathematician can be found in the hands of the tragedy poet. The most useful skill that comes from differential calculus is the ability to optimize. Optimization is the process of finding the maximum or minimum values of a function with respect to a constraint. If the authors of tragedy seek to maximize the valuation of their tragedy, they can employ the same techniques found in math, such as Lagrange multipliers, to determine what tragic components would make the plot the most tragic. There are many mathematical techniques with functional equivalents in literature.Works Cited

Alain Mabanckous 2015 novel Black Moses, or originally Little Pepper, tells a picaresque story of Tokumisa Nzambe po Mose yamoyindo abotami namboka ya Bakoko, mostly known to others as simply Moses. Moses tale, beginning in an orphanage and ending in prison, takes the reader on a tour of the cultural and political zeitgeist of late 1960s Central Africa, specifically of post-colonialism and the rise of communism. Moses character and journey through life serve as a metaphor for the sociopolitical climate in the country, as his relationships to religion and identity become analogous to that of the Peoples Republic of Congo.
Moses childhood as an orphan leaves him with limited parental figures. Those he does have, the orphanages Papa Moupelo and Pointe-Noires Maman Fiat 500, are both removed from his life by authority figures such as the director of the orphanage and the mayor of Pointe-Noire, respectively. Additionally, both of these figures provide him with a limited connection to religion that he does have, and are removed by figureheads who represent communism and the new political era of the Congo. In practice, Marxism heavily discourages religion, as it provides a distraction from the class consciousness that prerequisites a communist revolution. The significance of this lies in the forceful severance of the connection to religion that the people of the Congo were so familiar with by the new communist political movement thats taken hold in the country. Similarly, Moses religious connections have been expunged from his life by figures with strong ties to both politics and communism.
Moses is not only bereft of a traditional familial structure but also of an ethnic identity. The cultural norms in the Congo heavily emphasize ethnic identities, and theyre frequently cited when explaining the behavior or opinions of a wide variety of characters. Moses, however, has no personal cultural norm, instead borrowing from a variety of ethnic customs, especially of those surrounding him. He eats cat meat, adopted from the Bemb and Tk ethnicities, knows the dance of the Pygmies from Zaire, and has a long name as is common in Zaire. Just like Moses, the country of the Congo has a rich and diverse ethnic makeup of a variety of cultures from around the region, in that the general population of the country has an understanding of what is characteristic of each ethnic group. We can conclude that both Moses and the Congo are amalgamations of a complex cultural makeup.
Moses finds various replications of family throughout his life, not only in the twins gang in Pointe-Noire but also in Maman Fiat 500 and her girls. He spends most of his early life under the aegis of another group, and most of his day-to-day activity centered around helping to support it. He does this through hunting and thieving for the twins and small errands for Maman Fiat 500. This proceeds until Maman Fiat 500 is taken from him, leaving him effectively alone in the world. After this occurs, he develops amnesia and begins to feel lost in himself and his identity, even more so than before. The Congo has been under French control for nearly a century, and now that its a free state, its struggling under post-colonialism to forge an individual identity. This leads us to believe that Moses story is a reflection of this internal turmoil, which in him, results in amnesia and neurological disorders.
Religion serves an overarching theme throughout the novel, especially at the beginning. At the orphanage and under Papa Moupelos counsel, religion is very important to Moses, and is a major focus of his internal thoughts, specifically about his own identity. The anti-religious themes of the government are stated early on in the novel, and the name of the main character, which also serves as the title, has religious connotations. Religion is a heavy theme throughout the novel. Alain Mabanckou tells a larger story with Moses as a literary surrogate for the Congo, creating a depiction of the youth of its independence through the novels main character. Alain Mabanckous usage of Moses as a literary representation of the Congo provides emphasis on the role that religion plays in the narrative of this new and independent country.

This man that now lays in this casket made of sacred wood from our own hills, has cursed our land with his presence, bringing with him destruction and pain. If you dont believe me, let me speak and you will see. When I was young, I lived in peace with the land. I called out to the trees one by one as if they were my brothers. The trees have magic properties, and only tell the truth when I seek for answers.[1] I met a beautiful woman by the river and, like my father and grandfather, I planted the land, which in turn gave me its treasures.[2] Thus I lived, until one day I saw smoke in the sky above my plantation. The French had burned my land and my hut, made of iron and wood which they despised, and claimed that the entire village hated me for being so fortunate and happy.[3] It was then that I sensed that a dangerous force was entering our village. 
Soon after, I saw our people revolt, burning the plantations and running to the towns, inevitably returning in a worse state than before.[4] I saw as the moons bright beams replaced by electric poles, houses were built of concrete and the trees of life fell with one blow onto the barren land.[5] I have visited every last tree, bush and weed in this village, and thus the land showed me all that it has to know. Its been years since Ive known the entire history of this place, and I cannot keep his secret hidden any longer. The very man that lies in this casket has committed the most heinous crimes this place has ever seen. I myself have scratched the earth and found the tortured bodies under the moss and lichen. I come every night at dusk to that very place and pray for the eternal happiness of these people.[6] When I see him here, my eyes burn into his, and he lowers his head before me, for he knows that he is guilty.[7] I believe that nature suffocated him, like a boa suffocating its prey. The earth could not deal with a wicked man walking freely on its soil, so it lured him into its forest and trapped his soul deep underground. This explains the lack of blood on the discovered body, for only a force greater than all of us could have killed a human in such a way. When the earth took his soul, he fell face down into the mud, and his body gave up then and there. I have here a piece of wood from the tree under which his victims are buried, representing both his transgressions and his fateful death. This tree whispered this mans secrets into my ear and brought justice to this island. Now I can die in peace, and while my body sinks into the ground, my soul will enter eternal heaven. 
------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Their fragrance is magic, a power recaptured from times long gone by (201).
[2] One day I was washing my old clothes in the river when [Gracieuse] appeared in front of me, her tray balanced on her head (202).
[3] According to [the French], the entire village hated me for being so fortunate and happy (203).
[4] The women observed them as they went, wiping the tears from their eyes and cradling their bastard children in their arms, knowing full well in the secret of their hearts that this jubilation would not last and that soon poverty would bring them home again (204).
[5] I watched the electric poles go up, the roads tarred, the houses built of concrete and cars running on four wheels (204).
[6] I scratched the earth and whitewashed the conch shells, and every evening at dusk I come here to kneel on my two knees (205).
[7] Every time I meet him my eyes burn into his, and he lowers his head, for this is his crime (205).This test is on all the cases we have covered so far. It is open note and open course pack.
Focus on logic, try to answer as directly as possible.
Question 1
Justice Jackson writes that There are limits to the extent to which a legislatively represented majority may conduct biological experiments at the expense of the dignity and personality and natural powers of a minority. What limits might there be under this ruling? What limits should there be overall? Consider Jacobson when answering.
	In context, this quote comes at the very end of the decision, after establishing the holding in Skinner, which was unrelated to the nature of the punishment of sterilization, rather only to the equal protection under the law against such a cruel and unusual punishment. The judges were more keen to point out the cruelty of sterilization when it came to a man, Skinner, as opposed to a woman, Carrie Buck. Aside from the due process holding in Skinner, Justice Jackson suggests that the government cannot unconditionally execute biological experimentation. I think that the term biological experimentation is somewhat confusing yet I have failed to derive a better term. It sufficiently captures what we are concerned with, when the government requires some atypical medical procedure that one would not normally undergo for their general wellbeing. An example of such a procedure is sterilization. On the contrary, vaccination is, arguably, normalized as part of ones general wellbeing.
Jacobson introduces the use of science and health in constitutional interpretation. Vaccination provides everyone in a community with health. Jacobson establishes that communal liberty of being healthy supersedes individual corporal liberty when there is no evident harm to the individual. The exercise of police power to enforce vaccination is justified for this reason, because sciencean ethos not quite as powerful as the word of the constitution, given that in can be overridden by what is commonly understood, as seen in Lochnercan demonstrate that vaccination is not harmful to the three key areas mentioned: a minoritys dignity, personality, and natural powers.
In general, in order to be appropriate, it seems that a governments biological experiment must pass two tests: whether it violates dignity, personality, and natural powers, and intermediate scrutiny. To begin with, intermediate scrutiny, which is more strict than the rational basis test, yet more cursory than strict scrutiny, says the state may enact experimentation, violate certain rights, and discriminate in that violation only when it has a very good reason for doing so. In this case, as aforementioned, the state has a good reason to violate the freedom to do whatever one wants with their body to ensure health, in addition to the fact that the state would only discriminate with application of the legislation against groups of people that cannot be vaccinated. This is a reasonable descrimination, and thus passed intermediate scrutiny. Finally, experimentation that violates dignity, personality, and natural powers, must be unreasonable, permanent, and immoral respectively. Firstly, dignity is the weakest rule as some medical procedures need to violate this concept in order to be executed. Reasonable procedures do not extend this violation beyond what is necessary. Secondly, violation of personality implies a permanent change to one's person. Again, some procedures must do this, but a good procedure will not seek to alter one's person unless necessary. Thirdly, experimentation that violates natural powers, in my mind, insinuates a religious undertone, that there exist some God-given powers. On the plane or religiosity also exists morals. Thus procedures that do not wish to violate natural powers as defined religiously must adhere to the moral guidelines defined in the same way.
Question 2
The court has, in the past, protected rights that are so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? (100 words)
	
The traditions and conscience of people constitute the un-codified common law. The ninth amendment verifies the existence of these implied rights that reside in the ill-defined common law by suggesting that there are other rights retained by the people, that are not mentioned elsewhere in the bill of rights (9th Amendment). 
The advantages of the ninth is that it can support arguments for non-written rights, such as Justice Douglass peripheral/penumbral rights. 
However, the disadvantage of such a lenient and malleable definition of rights is that it brings the Courts bias when determining what rights are, in fact, penumbral. 
In dissent, Justice Black concludes that judges might invalidate legislation offensive to their personal preferences (101).
He mentions another justice, Justice Learned Hand, who said that he would not want, to be ruled by a bevy of Platonic Guardians (101).
This connects to the first guiding question provided in our discussion of Roe, about Justice Holmes stating, [The Constitution] is made for people of fundamentally differing views in that the conscience of our people may not be such an identifiable entity because of how diverse our opinions are (110). Yet, nonetheless, the judges must not let their opinions influence the law that is created from the traditions and conscience of our people.
To analogize with math, the judges are afraid of skewing a datas average with their own individual opinions. However, their opinions are just one in the many opinions that were used to determine the peoples average in the first place. This means that, when we make legislation only from our traditions, we are bound to stagnate in our laws. This is a disadvantage because we will not be striving toward a more perfect union.
Question 3
Myers and Pierce, Griswold and Eisenstadt. These cases are often grouped together. What do matching cases show about the Supreme Court and how decisions are made and modified? (100 Words)
quote to show how language of cases is similar
Question 4
Justice Harlan says that the preamble is not a source of substantive power. What is the role of the preamble when reading the Constitution?
The preamble provides a thematic context for the Constitution. What types of values will it uphold? Will we have positive or negative rights? That being said, while it gives an abstract of the spirit of the Constitution, the justices claim that it does not have legal power, that only resides in the words of the body. Although, the justices do say that it is appropriate to extract implied meaning from the articles of the Constitution, therefore implications may also be expressed in the preamble, but one cannot source from it.
It seems sort of like citing a research paper, one may reference the abstract, but that is not where the substantive data tables or intricate conclusions lie.
Question 5
Consider how time alters how a decision is seen. In the 1920s, eugenics was approved of in the U.S. By the 1940s, this theory was tied to Nazism. What might the court learn from history when issuing rulings that involve sociological theories? (100 Words)
The court often places importance on historical precedent. The constitutional interpretation framework that most emphasizes this is judicial precedentdeciding cases based on past decisions. This method will induce gradual changes to legislation over item, as all new cases must be determined by adhering to the same logic as past cases.
If some sociological theory, such as eugenics is introduced, it will have a long lasting impact if judicial precedent is used in all subsequent cases that concern related topics in eugenics. 
The court should be cautious with issuing rulings because, just as easily as a novel theory can be introduced, so too can it fall out of fashionas realized by the fact that it was employed by a fascist regime. To expand, legislation based on fads should always be carefully examined to ensure that the idea is indeed societally beneficial. 
While the fact that the court made decisions in support of eugenics in the 20s, it reflects better that they were able to make better decisions in the 1940s. The times are always subject to change.
 
Question 6
Many of the cases we have covered have had powerful dissents. What dissent do you believe is the most impactful and why? (100 Words)
Question 7
Two cases that we have covered are now considered to be poor decisions. Lochner v. New York and Buck v. Bell. What do these cases have in common? (100 words)
	Buck is a poor decision because they treat mental differences as a disease that needs to be eradicated. It is not, having people with mental differences living in society is not harmful to society. Thus, sterilization, as the states method of enacting that extermination, is allowed. 
	Lochner made the poor majority decision because the Judges are not scientists, so they cannot accurately determine the healthiness of baking. They wrongfully determined that, based on their common knowledge, baking is not particularly harmful. Therefore, people should have the freedom to work as much as they want without control of the state.
	They both have the flaw of allowing too much individual control to the states, where more constitutional regulation of states would stand to allow more freedom to the individuals residing in those states. Additionally, both decisions wrongfully utilize, or rather ignore, science in their decisions. Buck states that imbecility is genetic, when it is not necessarily. And Lochner claims that bakery work is not inherently more unhealthy than other occupations with similar hours, neglecting the respiratory concerns from the aerosolized flour particulate. If science had been properly employed to inform the decisions of these cases, they likely would have been more reasonably decided.
 
Question 8
Douglas finds the right to privacy in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 9th Does this right exist? Where do you agree/disagree with his description? (100 Words)
The penumbral right of privacy is generated most explicitly in the order of the 9th, the 
Question 9
Is rational basis a strong enough protection of fundamental rights? And is it the courts duty to determine not only constitutionality but also what is and is not a rational means and end for a legislature?

Contemplations on the nature of criminals
____________________________
Why are almost all crimes so conspicuous, so easily discovered, and the traces of almost all criminals revealed so obviously?1 It is the case that, almost without fail, a criminal will, during and after the commission of a crime, commit certain errors which render them vulnerable to identification and conviction. This tendency is due to a failure of the mind -  the criminal himself, at the very moment of the crime, is subject to some failure of willpower and reason which leads him to, consciously or unconsciously, reveal himself.2 This eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness, develop gradually, and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime. 3 There are some few men for whom this is not the case; but the ordinary criminal is self-defeating.
The ordinary criminal is not only self-defeating, but self-punishing as well! He is content to be punished for transgressing, and may even carry out the punishment himself.4 He suffers, and lives for suffering, because it is a reminder of his natural state; he punishes himself because he knows he has done more than his right; he suffers because he has overstepped without reason.
What is it about the mind of the criminal that causes him to behave in this way - to (intentionally or unintentionally) reveal himself, to make himself vulnerable, and to punish himself for his transgression? The answer is a fundamental fact of human psychology: the ordinary man is predisposed to obedience and submission; to live only according to the laws and customs of the society they are born into.5 Therefore, when confronted with the possibility of committing an evil act - a transgression - he hesitates. He holds back. He becomes so preoccupied, so singularly focused, on whether or not he should commit a crime, that he fails to execute it correctly. The only thing that can compel him forward is a defect in, or a failure of, his natural tendencies; a lapse in reason great enough to allow him to transgress.6 It is not that the commission of a crime or the possibility thereof creates an illness in him; such a mental defect is required for the criminal act to occur. Either they must be insane enough to cross the threshold without caring what lies on the other side, or they must be rational enough to see beyond an evil act to a greater good. Those who are willing to transgress, and do so with reason and clarity of mind, are the truly extraordinary - those who can permit themselves to wade through blood to reach a better future.7
 
Ordinary men are men of the present; they live and die by laws set down by greater forebears. In this way, they are incapable of originality; like cattle or sheep, they follow the path set for them.8 The extraordinary man is a man of the future9 - he can see beyond the world of today, to the world of tomorrow; and he can permit himself to overstep the bounds of the ordinary to achieve his great aims. What truly separates the extraordinary man from the ordinary is the formers capacity for original thought. The extraordinary man is capable of uttering new words; of conceiving of novel, even revolutionary, ideas and conceptions of the world; and he has the right to do what is necessary to achieve them.10 The extraordinary can be prophets like Mohammed; scientists like Newton or Kepler; lawgivers like Solon or Lycurgus; and conquerors like Napoleon.11 But what makes them extraordinary is their singular, original visions of the future, and their capacity and obligation to realize those visions. That is the burden of the extraordinary man.

OF THE RESURRECTION
                 S. Semyonovna
____________________________
OMSK  The act of murder does not extinguish one life, but two - that of the victim, and that of the murderer.1 In committing such an act, the soul is rent from the grace and salvation of God. To murder is to cause irreparable harm to Creation - to that part of Creation made in Gods image. The only hope for a murderer, the only way to begin on the path to redemption, is resurrection. For the LORD says I am the resurrection and the Life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.2
Resurrection is not redemption3; it is merely the first step along that path. The path to redemption requires penance and atonement for sin; but in order to repent, one must believe in repentance; the murderer must go to the crossroads, stand before God and the people, and confess; then God will send him new life.4 For a soul to be forgiven, and brought into the eternal light of love, it must first be alive. The dead are incapable of receiving love; the living reciprocate it.5 To a dead man, love and grace are simply reminders of the infinite love and grace they have rejected; to the living soul, love is the ultimate source of life, a wellspring of light.6 To open ones heart to suffering is to open it also to joy. The living soul does not fear death, for it has seen the resurrection.7 I have seen the resurrection, and I do not fear death.

   AGAINST IDEOLOGY
             D. P. RAZUMIKHIN
____________________________
The great scholars and philosophers of the day purport to have captured the essence of human nature in a few lines of mathematical logic. They reject life! They truly believe that the entire secret of life fits on two sheets of printers paper.1 The complexity of creation and the nature of each person is not considered; but those realities are the very point of human existence! Pure ideology is a rejection of life and of human nature. In the great modernity, all people can be distilled into a single equation; cogs in an ideological machine.2 Forget about living; livings not important - only ideology.3 The utopians construct phalansteries like mausoleums; temples to modernity in which the souls of the dead go to be entombed.4 The paradise they envision is a sterile, lifeless world; their ideal state acting as the mechanical executor of ideology. Even if their social system can be made of rubber and smells a bit like carrion - its still not alive, it has no will, its slavish, it doesnt rebel!5 The socialists can excuse any evil if it serves a common good6, and reject the notion that human acts are caused by human nature;7 the utilitarians reduce every moral action into a mathematical formula! There is no room for humanity - no room for life - in any of their views of the world. But one cannot leap over human nature by means of logic alone! The enlightened scholars philosophize and debate over the most fundamental aspects of human morality in terms that defy reason. Death and suffering should not be so wantonly excused by ideology, lest we forget also the value of life.

 INSANITY AND REASON
____________________________
Insanity is fundamentally a failure of reason - when a vulnerable mind is confronted with two irreconcilable statements, both of which he believes to be true, but which cannot be, he is broken. Such a contradiction can be the fault of a logical error, or an incorrect view of things.1 In the end, the result is the same: the patient has brought these ideas into themselves - he has incorporated them into his psyche so fully, that, when confronted with the reality that they are irreconcilable, rather than discarding one or the other, he fixates on that contradiction. This is a monomania: a singular fixation on this unresolvable question posed to oneself.2
This sickness consumes them - twisting and contorting their every waking thought, forcing indecision and erratic behavior as the patients mind is turned upon itself. This kind of insanity is often accompanied with irrational, even criminal behavior3 - for in such a state, one might be compelled to do anything to resolve the contradiction. Such an illness might be accompanied by physical ailments alongside mental ones; these being the material manifestation of a psychological ill: the blood crying out within oneself.4
The only way to treat this kind of illness is by confronting the paradox at its source; one must persuade the person that the dilemma they are confronted with is false - by reasoning and contradiction.6

 ON CRIME - A RESPONSE
                 P. PETROVICH
____________________________
I will begin by acknowledging points of agreement with the preceding article. It is true, in my experience, that the deepest and most revealing weakness of the criminal is his psychology.1 It is natural for a criminal to doubt his actions; to question the reason behind what he is doing, as well as to interrogate his every move for any hint of guilt or suspicion.2 The criminal becomes preoccupied, and indeed singularly focused, on committing the crime. This monomania leads them to lose their reason; to, subconsciously, reveal themselves.3 I must, however, raise several points of disagreement with the preceding article. First, that those who view themselves as able to commit crimes without suspending their reason or willpower are truly able to evade their natural tendency to reveal themselves; second, that it is perhaps impossible to determine, by such a standard, who is extraordinary and who is not; and third, that it is permissible, morally and societally, to commit such evil acts if they serve some greater good.
In the first case: it has been my experience that those who view themselves as able to commit crimes with impunity are not themselves invulnerable to the irrationality that plagues the ordinary criminal.4  This is human nature; even - indeed especially - for those who believe themselves to be extraordinary. [They lie] incomparably well, but they [cant] rely on their own nature.5 They become, in many cases, too clever - too caught up in the dance of suspicion and investigation - and in so doing, reveal themselves.6
In the second: if there are, as is proposed, two predominant categories of people - the ordinary and the extraordinary, the leaders and the followers, the men of the present and of the future - how might we go about determining who is who?7 Many people might naturally assume that they themselves are in that lucky few. After all, one does not like to think of oneself as naturally mute and subservient. It is therefore the case that many people would like to be extraordinary, and many people are willing to overstep, even if they are not truly extraordinary; how then can we distinguish between the two categories?
Finally, I take issue with this idea that such extraordinary men may be obligated to feel sorrow for their actions, but are not obligated to suffer for them.8 They do not take on the guilt or the responsibility for such an act, because it was necessary to achieve their lofty goals. Theirs is a noble sorrow, distant from the reality of bloodshed. One who can numb himself to blood and sin is not truly alive; he is an automaton, simply carrying out a calculated sequence of events to their pre-ordained conclusion. Guilt and suffering are signs of life!9 Go on, suffer   dont philosophize too cleverly; give yourself up to life directly, without deliberating; dont worry!10 
In the end, does it matter? Does it truly matter whether you are ordinary or extraordinary? You are yourself, a singular and original soul; you possess a life that is yours, given to you by God - live it! The extraordinary man is no man at all if he has no heart or living soul - if he operates only according to mechanical logic derived from coldly calculated theories.11 Well then, so what if you have to join a different category of men?  Its not time that matters, but you yourself. Become a sun and everyone will see you. Most of all, the sun should be the sun.12

Whats More Important: Action or Intention?
One of the key components of an action is the intention behind it. Intention is interesting in the sense that it rarely can be observed from outside an individuals inner thoughts. Instead, intention is a thought only known to ones self, which makes it difficult for others to pick up on. This is precisely why it can be so difficult to judge others by their intentions rather than their actions. More often than not, intention can be the determining factor for the morality of not only the action itself, but the person behind it. Intention, in its simplest form, is a wish that one means to accomplish. In this definition, the keyword is mean because even if one means to do something, there is still a chance it may not become reality. In other words, intention has the ability to influence a situation but doesnt necessarily determine the outcome of that situation. In comparison, action is the thing that is physically being done rather than the desire for what should be done. Judging the morality of actions themselves, however, can prove to be difficult. An action can be deemed virtuous if it employs behavior with high moral standards, including high moral intentions. Primarily, a virtuous action is an action that benefits others or a community positively. The opposite can be said for immoral actions, where they would be considered not virtuous when they entail intentionally doing harm to others. Another situation where a contrast between action and intention can be seen is in tragic stories, where it is common for good characters to make tragic mistakes. Specifically in the tragedies Macbeth, by William Shakespeare, and Oedipus the King, by Sophocles, can a connection between good and bad intentions and actions be seen to influence the overall virtue of the main characters. As proven by the main characters in Macbeth and Oedipus the King, a character is deemed virtuous not because of their actions, but rather because of their intentions.
	To many who read the tragedy of Macbeth, the main character, Macbeth, comes off as a bloody tyrant, who is a terrible person down to his core. But the reason why many readers think this about him is not entirely because of the many atrocious murders he committed, but rather because of the fact that he committed them willingly, intentionally, and with full knowledge that they were morally wrong. Macbeths cruel intentions can clearly be seen shortly after the story begins. Macbeth is famously prophesied to be the future King of Scotland by three witches. When Macbeth later encounters Duncan, the current King of Scotland, Duncan mentions that his son Malcolm will be his heir to the throne. After hearing this news, Macbeths desire to become king turns to obsession as he plots to kill Duncan, so he can claim the throne. Macbeths first step into darkness can be observed after his meeting with Duncan where he states, Stars, hide your fires;/Let not light see my black and deep desires (Shakespeare 1.4.57-58). When Macbeth mentions his deep desires, he refers to his desire to kill Duncan so he can become king. This is further shown by the use of the word black, which implies that his desires are evil. Macbeth's inner thoughts prove his negative intentions in addition to his later-seen full willingness to kill for his own rapacity. This exhibits how Macbeth is not a virtuous person, since he describes his own desires as so evil that even light can not see them. Furthermore, the fact that Macbeth had full knowledge that the murders he committed were morally wrong gives him no excuse for murdering Duncan. This can clearly be seen right after Macbeth exits Duncans room after killing Duncan when Macbeth refuses to go back because [he is] afraid to think about what [he has] done/Look on t again [he] dare not (Shakespeare 2.3.65-67). When Macbeth mentions that he is afraid to think about what [he has] done, this implies that he knew the murder was morally wrong from the start by bringing to light that he knows he will feel bad about killing Duncan if he returns to the body. This is an important factor to recognize because if Macbeth had rather unknowingly or accidentally killed Duncan instead of plotting an elaborate murder, he may have been judged differently by readers. The fact that Macbeth knowingly and intentionally did something he knew was morally wrong proves he is not virtuous in the sense that he is intentionally harming others.
	Very different from Macbeth, however, is the story of Oedipus the King, by Sophocles. In this historic Greek tragedy, Oedipus is a man who unknowingly kills his father, unintentionally marries his mother, and takes on his fathers title as King of Thebes. Towards the middle of the story, Oedipus mentions how he was prophesied this fate by the god Apollo, and how that was the reason why he fled his home in Corinth. When he finally opens up about the prophecy to his wife, he admits that Apollo told me onceit is my fateI must make love with my own mother, shed my fathers blood with my own hands. So for years Ive given Corinth a wide berth, [...] but still, to see ones parents and look into their eyes is the greatest joy I know (Sophocles 216). When Oedipus tells readers how to see ones parents and look into their eyes is the greatest joy, this indicates how much Oedipus loves his parents and how he pains to not see them. Not only that, but when Oedipus mentions how it was because of the prophecy that he has given Corinth a wide berth, this shows how selfless Oedipus is, for he is willing to sacrifice his own happiness if it means avoiding hurting his parents. However, Macbeth is oblivious to the fact that he was adopted and that the man he had killed in a conflict on his way to Thebes was his real father and his real mother is his wife. In this scenario, Oedipus sacrificing his own joy to avoid causing harm to his parents reflects extremely honorable intentions. However, his actions do not reflect these intentions at all, for he has indeed succumbed to the fate he was trying so hard to avoid. Yet, even though Oedipuss actions were terrible, it is still fair to say that Oedipus himself is still virtuous because of his good intentions. Even though Oedipus caused harm to his parents, himself, and the entire kingdom, he didnt do so intentionally. Since immoral intention is included in the definition of an immoral character, Oedipus does not fall into that category as Macbeth did because he instead acted with good intentions. Unlike Macbeth, Oedipus was completely ignorant of the true nature of his actions and only learned of them at the end of the play. What this example shows is that intention is more important than action when it comes to determining whether or not a tragic hero is moral or immoral.
	In the end, even though intention may hint at a character's moral standings, this doesnt necessarily mean that intention completely dominates action. Its rather to say that honorable intentions have the power to pardon terrible actions in the right circumstances. In many books and plays, action is simple whereas intention is complex, and each story may harbor a different relationship between them. One might call it a moral tug-of-war between action and intention, where the strength of each side can change, therefore impacting a books moral foundation. This is precisely why it is so dangerous to jump into a new story with pre-existing ideas of action overshadowing intention or vice-versa. Our initial judgements of characters can be way off due to lack of context. So instead of jumping to the conclusion that a character is moral or immoral in a story without closely examining each side of the tug-of-war, one might avoid judgment until the end of the book when all is said and done.

ID410 - What is the Good Life
16 September 2022
The pressure on my ears needles me with pain. My eyes strain to open but falter against the clotted lashes. Burning lungs shudder and groan, but no air passes through my nose. Limbs ache, itching with the urge for movement. This false mask imprisons every inch of my being. My heart, now truly imprisoned, sinks with pain, dripping from my chest to pool at the soles of my feet.  Yet, this was all my own doing. I constructed this cocoon by choice. My own deft hands layered each piece of gleaming white clay onto the warm shine of my wooden calves. My own hands enveloped the crooks of my arms with cold false stone. What was it that I had desired? 
Before all of this, my wooden arms had shone with pigments more brilliant than rubies and emeralds. With pricked wood and jagged carvings, the sprawling asymmetry of my limbs threw the air around them into imbalance. The contrast of my true form, jarring against the pearlescent marble of my neighboring statues, disrupted many of those who had elected to walk through our exhibit. Their sweeping eyes widened at my image. Their bumbling feet would trip backward, wrinkled noses arcing away at my overwhelming presence. This had not always bothered me. There were a few visitors who would gravitate towards my side, smiles wide and easy, chatting with a friend, words tumbling over each other. I treasured these visitors, many of whom chose to pause by my side again and again, and I grew to love them as friends. Many of them were quite unique in their own right, comfortably wearing their imperfections with pride. I felt we held each other's sorrows and joys, spilling our most inner selves with the deepest compassion. I was free back then, in all my deformities I stretched to my fullest size, face crackling with joy when my palms caught the passing sun, illuminating me to my greatest might. If only it could have been that way forever. But as my time in the gallery lengthened, more and more unkind eyes would linger upon me, their stomachs knotting with my prolonged presence. These visitors were not content to look at the other carved sculptures, beautiful in their own right with limbs of gleaming marble, poised with unflawed anatomy. My garish presence caught their eyes, and their minds could not accept the countless little flaws. 
Why is this here?, they would ask, It doesn't belong, no true sculptor would have erred so much. 
Their words pierced me, each one sinking deeper into my heart with knife-like precision, each one crowding out the kind looks of those who cherished me for my rough-hewn edges and garish colors. It was then that I started with the clay. 
At first, my fingers tentatively concealed each divot and crack with a thin layer of slip, merely smoothing the irregular exterior. My pace quickened at the newly silky texture of my surface. Craving more, I smeared layer after layer of ever-thickening clay onto the entire surface of my body. I wanted to fill the cavities and clear myself of all criticism. I wanted all eyes to fall upon me kindly, unable to catch on any jagged edges or shocking colors. The clay doused my once fiery limbs. The quieting criticisms of the onlookers drove me on, their knives falling from my chest. It wasn't until my ears clogged that I realized what I had done. My eyes still unsealed, I gazed upon my form, gasping at what I had become. The clay was pristine and smooth, yes, but I had become a cheap imitation of my marble counterparts. This case had hidden all my flaws but had stolen away any character or emotion. My brilliance dimmed and I appeared to dwindle in size despite my extra layers. My eyes searched desperately for my loyal partners, but they had all drifted away, unable to find me among the marble. All that remained were my previous dissenters, only pausing for a fleeting gaze or word of approval before moving on and leaving me alone. Despite the lack of harsh words, my heart ached more than ever, now no longer swelling with the authentic love of my once dear companions. My body that had served me for so long sagged with grief for its former self and with a silent cry, my hands once more lifted the clay to seal my eyes and mouth, before finally becoming too heavy to raise again.
The pain of this performance spills over, it fills each crevice of my mind and stomach, tearing at the seams of my conscious. An unbearable pain shoots outwards and skirts along my skin, sparking the desire to stretch freely in the sun, with a body of my own free will, and to laugh and feel with my friends. The pressure builds in my fingertips, finally bursting through the clay cast. The warmth of the sun pierces my exposed fingers, further fueling the fire that burns through my arm, into my chest and head, and through my legs, shards of dry clay breaking and shattering on the floor. With the last fragments clattering to the floor, my eyes slowly flutter open, the sudden daylight blinding them and sending sharp jolts of pain into my skull. I gaze upon the stunned crowd, their jaws slack and eyes unblinking. They now slowly back away but with my newly regained brilliance, I no longer care, my spine shivers at the idea of the alternative. My eyes turn away from the stifling crowd and back onto my now unleashed form. With a lurch in my stomach, I become aware of the toll my foolishness has taken. The paint that once clung brightly to me now lays with the porous clay in an ashen pile around my feet. I stand free but naked and drab. My newly revived heart hammers in my chest. Unburdened fingers wheel about themselves, brushing the remnants of the flaking paint. Lips trembling, I pull my arms inward, the cold air stinging my uncovered back. Hands to my chest, I inhale, the breath in my lungs feeding the internal flame and, with growing resolve, decide to start anew. Smearing paint with the same fingers that had led to my imprisonment, I blend the most cheerful and eye-catching colors, my focus now directed entirely on my own pleasure and volition. Meeting each impurity with a grin, I restore myself beyond my former glory, newfound creativity peeping through the unlikely melds of rich pigments. Now at the height of my power, my friends gradually return, my new design calling for their company. Their words melt the scars from my heart, and I pull them ever closer, my eyes sparkling with relief and gratitude. The stray words of an anonymous passerby can no more puncture the pigments that now adorned me. My delight in myself and those who love me consumes the space entirely. ,    .4

ON CRIME
By R.R.R.
The Russia of today has become increasingly concerned with justice.17 The influx of residents to urban zones, such as Petersburg, has impoverished these very same cities. Poverty, in combination with its causal factor of poor economic conditions, spawns crime at a rate18 never before seen here in Peterburg. Today, it becomes necessary to understand crime and its perpetrators to begin to break its chokehold on society.
Nature has established two categories of people: the ordinary, and the extraordinary.22 All people are born within these bounds; All may become criminals, but only the extraordinary are permitted to commit crimes. The psychological state of the criminal during his crime5 depends on where the individual exists within the hierarchy. Crimes consist of both moral and legal transgressions. Society explicitly punishes legal violations, and implicitly chastises moral ones.
The definition of a criminal extends beyond one who commits legal transgressions, to any trailblazer of society. Anyone who strays from the zeitgeist with new ideas must first reject old ideas.19 Even those who are make small forays into uncharted ground are, by their experimenting nature, criminals.21 It follows that a criminal is extraordinary provided that his crimes require the destruction of the present order in the name of something better.20 For the criminal who is not extraordinary, yet has mistakenly convinced himself otherwise, a crime is always accompanied by suffering.24
The vast majority of all persons are born ordinary.25 The originality of a person is proportionate to the rarity of their birth. For example, at least one person out of a thousand will be in any way original, while men of genius are one out of millions.28 The ordinary man is not without purpose; he should increase the worlds population, such that the world is more likely to attain an extraordinary
agent of change27 who will move the world forward and lead it to its goal.29 Therefore both types of men ought to exist and have equally strong rights within this system.30 This system was established not by the extraordinary men, but rather by nature herself. This natural law mixes only a few extraordinary persons in with the ordinary masses. This natural mechanism is yet to be understood26.
When an extraordinary man wishes to instantiate his new idea, he may use whatever means necessary to, permit his conscience to overstep various obstacles.31 He may not need to violate the law in order to meet some of his ends, so the extraordinary man is not obligated to violate the law.32 In either case, the extraordinary man will not preoccupy himself with whether or not the law was violated. He is fixed upon only his goal. The priorities of the extraordinary man are most clearly exemplified in the Machiavellian idea that the ends justify the means. However, when an ordinary man attempts to follow the
same philosophy, he will be unable to surmount the legal obstacles established by society.
It is a rare event for an ordinary person to attempt to transgress. Most ordinary persons are obedient by nature.33 If an ordinary person thinks himself extraordinary, upon committing a crime, his conscience will render a self-inflicted punishment. His obedient conscience, which has been molded to the form of societys expectations of his submission, will recognize his actions as infractions against the laws under which he lives. He, nor any ordinary man, cannot change those laws, and he will therefore suffer because of his acknowledgement of powerlessness34.
	The final element of suffering is the ordinary mans realization that he is not extraordinary. His elevated position on the hierarchy matrix is now demonstrably false, as he was a victim to his conscience. The conscience will continue to be the impetus of the ordinary mans suffering. If ignorance and pride convinced him that he could be extraordinary, guilt and remorse remind him that he is not. The perpetual torment is twofold: the ordinary man has transgressed; and, unlike the extraordinary man, he does not wield power over his own conscience. So, the ordinary criminal must suffer.
The threat of crime in Russia today is not as injurious as it may appear. Because ordinary men will punish themselves, and most men are ordinary, crime will deal with itself as it propagates, provided that the criminal punishment infrastructure is well established.35 Society needs to be principally concerned with the extraordinary men, who are not deterred by legal consequence. When the extraordinary man is punished by the same means as are used for ordinary men, society may perceive that it has dealt with an ordinary mansociety is of course justified in such a punishment.36 The extraordinary man will only become recognized in the future37, when his change is reflected by the mass of humanity.36 All men are ordinary in the present, so all men must be punished for legal transgressions. This punishment, of course, won't hinder the extraordinary men of our future.

A Critical Response to, 
ON CRIME
By Porfiry Petrovich
The opinion piece, On Crime, holds many erroneous claims, which it considers to be assuasive to justice, but are, in fact, most dangerous to the principle. It is paramount to combat the absurd and fantastic45 stance made by the frantic fanatic fictioner and his idea that some of us are born with self-derived and deserved power. When the author shares his work, he intends46
to proudly45 broadcast that he considers himself to harness this power, that he is one of a class of, extraordinary men.47 The advantage of such status is that he may permit himself to commit crimes and avoid all repercussions. However, no one can avoid suffering for a crime.
The article claims that there exists a minute population of extraordinary menand that there is a great diversity in the extraordinary quality of these men, and that all other men are ordinary. Even if these odds were supposedly true, this ratio of all men does not reflect their originality.
For, there are most certainly imaginative people within our Petersburg48 who may not be extraordinary in the same sense as proposed by the terms author, that is, immune to their conscience. Even if these people eventually submit to their conscience, they would do so only after having transgressed; whether or not they ultimately yield to an obedient conscience does not erase the fact that a crime has been committed. Because the ordinary man is still a freethinker, as opposed to a drone under societal law, crime will not simply cease to be committed.
To self-assign the power to operate above all others is quintessentially arrogant.45 To permit one's conscience to be the judge, jury, and executioner of another's life is even worse than being granted those roles by some official authority of many men49a democratic body wields more power than any individual.50 Simply put, a man cannot be above all men as is God. By claiming such jurisdiction, the extraordinary man would claim to be god-like. This is a fundamental incongruity; man cannot put himself, nor his conscience, above men. (For the man who tries, the sequence of events might unfold just as the author
suggests: with crushing suffering.)
As established, the author is the sort of fellow51 to think himself extraordinary, and, as such, must be preparing to, utter a new word. However, a word of caution to those who are enthused52 by the idea of thinking themselves to be extraordinary: just the same, you cannot escape justice. If justice means punishment, so too will punishment be inevitable. Thus, it appears true that crime will always be accompanied by suffering. If society holds the letter of the law against you, you shall be dealt justice.53 If God knows your actions,54 as He always will, then you will suffer for them.  Punishment cannot be avoided as we are all, in Gods image, merely men.
One cannot grant oneself permission to transgress. It is most dangerous to consider oneself extraordinary and to be wrong; such a test is not worth the risk. If the only means of understanding that all men must atone for crimes is to commit crimes, it must then be necessary for some men to transgress. Therefore it is necessary for some men to suffer,55 to remind them that they are not extraordinary. Such a cycle of ordinary men committing crimes in order to realize their state would facilitate the exercise of justice, but lead it no further to its goal: to abate crime.

Bridges
A Poem
A bridge crosses a river.
In a city of rivers, canals, and islands, bridges are the connective tissue of the disparate organelles.
The lungs of the city suffocate in the heat5 to form a shared exhausted complexion.38
Her bridges provide a hiatus
from every edifice.
Each bridge, an elevated pathway
from the crush of the people.39
The air is devoid of the jingle of the feeble bells.40
The bridge is the conduit through which the citys ideas flow.
Like nerves of the city, bridges sense and feel.
Then, they reflect, like neurons, after the foot traffic sleeps at night.
An overpass provides passage across a canal8.
To cross a bridge is to make a choice about which place to be.41
To cross a bridge is to change place, and likewise, state of mind.42
To cross the same bridge twice is to revert one's choice.43
At the apex of the bridge, the gravity of choice will roll down in either direction.44

54.Its simply necessary to suffer. That means to accept suffering (501). Suffering, Rodion Romanych, is a great thing (508).In democratic and communist countries, our political ideologies have failed us. Nearly every pillar that the architects of American democracy promised to uphold has been shattered. Democratic elections, once trusted as a system central to democracy itself, are now regarded as corrupt and rigged. Distrust of political and economic elites is reflected across the political spectrum. Wealth gaps are increasing, the hostile divide between liberals and conservatives is widening, and mass shootings have become an epidemic. Communism, too, has not followed through on its promises. Far from creating a proletarian utopia, it has created corrupt and powerful bureaucracies that have largely given up on socialism in order to pursue their own riches. How do we grapple with the fact that the political philosophies that we have adhered to for centuries have resulted in a society plagued with issues that seem utterly disconnected and unsolvable by the existing power structures? Are there underlying themes for how modern society undermines these political systems? The economic and political philosophies that have dominated the twentieth and twenty-first century rely on a lack of diversity and complexity and thus they are not capable of solving the current issues that arise from modern society. 
Traditional political ideologies are in part incompatible with progress because they were built upon the idea of a state of nature, a concept that assumes that humans are imbued with universal characteristics and are homogenous in nature. However, this practice of forming a political ideology based on a state of nature becomes problematic when such political ideologies are applied to culturally diverse societies. This is so because humans are not born with any such essence. As Sartre explains, existence comes before essence, meaning that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world - and defines himself afterwards. For this reason, building a political philosophy based on a state of nature is only suited for a homogenous group that fits the philosophers assumptions about human predispositions in a state of nature. For example, consider Lockes state of nature and his advocacy for representative democracy. Locke believed that all people are given an innate right to punish the offender and be the executioner of the law of nature. From this, he concludes that representative democracy is the best form of government as people can be trusted to be the executioner of the law and act according to their innate morals. However, while a representative democracy might work in a society composed of like-minded individuals with similar moral codes, such a political system begins to erode in a society composed of multiple cultures with contradicting values. For instance, the increasing cultural diversity of the United States is leading to an increased polarization between liberals and conservatives. This increasing polarization between liberals and conservatives has begun to undermine American democracy. The capitol insurrection, the rollback of voting rights, and the politicization of the supreme court are all evidence that a democratic political philosophy based on Lockes view that we are all imbued with the right to be the executioner of our innate moral values seems to break down in a society composed of different cultural groups with different moral values. Or otherwise stated, political philosophies that make foundational assumptions about the state of nature are contingent on a lack of cultural diversity and thus do not work effectively in a modern society. 
Even political philosophies that were not specifically grounded on a particular view of the state of nature were still founded on assumptions regarding the homogeneity of society because they were crafted in times when society tended to be more homogenous. For example, in A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, published in 1859, Karl Marx advocates for a social revolution to bring about a communal system that makes individual labor appear as the direct function of a member of a social organism and makes it impossible for the labor of the individual to be private labor and his product to be a private product. This socialist economy that Marx describes is suited for a homogenous society. For example, Kibbutzes, egalitarian and socialist communities in Israel, have been described as a successful implementation of socialism. This is due to the fact that the members of these communities share similar values and thus both trust and care for each other. Members trust that others will complete their share of work and will work towards fulfilling the same values that they prioritize. However, while socialism works in this environment, Marx failed to acknowledge the issue of trust that would emerge from implementing a socialist economy in a larger, heterogeneous society. For instance, socialism failed miserably in the Soviet Union for many reasons, including the fact that there were no economic incentives for people to work hard and there was no common cultural fabric that allowed people to trust that their hard work would be replicated by all their comrades. Therefore, even though socialism was not imagined with a distinct state of nature as its foundation, its success still presupposes the homogeneity of a society because it was conceived at a time that could not comprehend the full scale of diversity that exists in modern society. 
	Given that the dominant political and economic ideologies of the past two centuries have not succeeded in governing modern society, it seems that our only hope of solving modern problems is to create a new political philosophy. However, as illustrated by Fanons The Wretched of the Earth, truly eliminating the hierarchical systems left by oppressive regimes is impossible, and thus creating a new political philosophy that does not build upon pre-existing power structures is not a possible solution for solving current issues. Fanons exploration of decolonization serves as an example for decolonization efforts in our current society, which could be argued to have been colonized by Western political philosophy. The colonized, in this case, are those that are oppressed by dominant political philosophies, and the colonizers are those that are advantaged by these political philosophies and use their power to maintain these power structures. Fanon writes, [the definition of decolonization] can, if we want to describe it accurately, be summed up in the well-known words: The last shall be first. In other words, in getting rid of a particular oppressive political system, another oppressive political system will take its place. After a social revolution, the peoples that were oppressed by a political system will inevitably rise to the top of the hierarchical power structure and become the oppressor. This is not the oppressed people's fault as hierarchy is the only system they can comprehend after living under a hierarchical system. The desire to climb to the top creeps into every persons values and goals, infesting all facets of livelihood. Therefore, modern society cannot create a new political philosophy suited to its diversity because political ideologies will always advantage a certain homogenous group and disadvantage the rest. 
 Perhaps if hierarchical political ideologies had from the beginning assumed the existence of culturally diverse societies, we could have a political system that is fit for governing a diverse population. However, this would mean that societies would have had to be diverse from the beginning of time. This is not the case. Therefore, the best way to move forward is to implement a political system that allows for the government to evolve with society. The current political system that is most likely to evolve with society is democracy as it gives power to the evolving people. While democracy is clearly not perfect, it seems to be the best option at present for governing diverse, modern societies.
     Adam Smiths invisible hand of the market works because, according to Locke, it is human nature to be self-interested - but self-interest is shortsighted. The role of government is to account for positive and negative externalities in market prices (to ensure that the market adequately reflects the true cost or profit from the use of a product to society as a whole) and to guarantee access to certain essential goods and services which are necessary for full participation in a free society and not well served by the self-interested action of markets. Markets are a powerful tool to shape an economy and a society, but they are not infallible, nor should they be universal.
     In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith argues for the value and expediency of markets; the idea that everyone working purely towards their own self-interest, in a free society, results in the most efficient allocation of wealth.  A participant in such an economic system "intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention ... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it." (Smith) Human self-interest, according to Smith, is the best way to organize an economic system. 
John Locke's ideal government fits well with Adam Smith's ideal economy. According to Locke, "the state that all people are in naturally ... is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature." (Locke) Locke wanted a government that worked to preserve that natural state by allowing individuals as much freedom of choice and action as possible. The problem with a purely Lockean government from an economic perspective is that markets are not infallible; they are effective at determining the value of labor and goods in the abstract, but often fail to correctly factor in large-scale, societal costs to the production or sale of a particular good. Take gasoline: the consumption and use of gas in cars has significant costs - increased carbon emissions, wear on public infrastructure, increased injuries and fatalities in traffic - but because those costs are borne at a societal level, and not on the level of the individual, there is no reason for any given person to take those costs into account when participating in a market for gas. One critical role of the government in the marketplace is to adjust, via subsidies, taxes, and regulations, the price of certain goods (like gas) that are not correctly evaluated by the marketplace. In doing so, the government can price in external factors, perfecting the ideal marketplace, while not compromising the Lockean freedom of choice that is central to their function.
     There are also instances where markets are not the most societally optimal way to apportion supply or determine prices. Essential goods and services like potable water, electricity, internet access, food, and roads, should not be restricted only to those who have the ability to pay market prices for them. In order for a free society to function, everyone in it has to be able to live in it. The goal of a public utility is not to make a profit but to provide an essential service to the public - therefore, they are not subject to the same market pressures that private companies competing to sell a product are. A purely Lockean government, working towards the maximum freedom of personal action could not justify the provision of these essentials in this way because it does necessarily remove some amount of personal choice in both consumption and taxation. 
     According to Jean-Jacque Rousseau, however, this is acceptable. By entering into a society, individuals must accept some loss of their absolute liberty - even if only to allow for the realization of Lockes ideal of absolute ownership of property: What man loses by the social contract is his natural liberty and an unlimited right to everything he tries to get and succeeds in getting; what he gains is civil liberty and the proprietorship of all he possesses. Rousseau posits that in order to exist in any society, we must necessarily give up a bit of personal choice to the government of that society - and in exchange, we gain the ability to act freely within that society. Essential to that freedom of action is the ability to participate in markets freely; how could one do so without access to roads, or electricity, or the internet? Also essential to free participation in an economy is the ability to simply survive - necessitating the socialization of public utilities like water and food. A truly free market must be accompanied by a government that is able to administer those essential services. 
     Markets are so effective because they are driven by pure self-interest; but this is precisely why they cannot be purely free or universal. Above all else, the ideal economic system is the one that best serves the public interest. In a democratic, free society, people must be free to be self-interested, to form markets, and to compete with each other in them; but they must also be free to access essential products at reasonable prices, and must be willing to bear the costs of providing those public goods. This is the social contract that must underlie any truly free marketplace. 
Dear Caesar,
I am Machiavelli and you have been assassinated. Let us go over what you should have done to maintain your power. 
Your goal was to turn a Republic into a Monarchy and while you technically succeeded in the long run, your pride got in the way of you seeing the fruits of your labor. You started on the right track by focusing on gaining the support of the populous instead of the nobles. The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail (Machiavelli, IX). Initially, you enacted many political reforms that were popular with the people: the reformation of the calendar and the redistribution of land in favor of the plebeians and veterans. Even though some of your decisions angered the elites, this was not the cause of your downfall. It was only when the elites were able to turn the nobles against you on account of your greed that you became endangered. 
Of course, many think that your crossing of the Rubicon against the Senates order was the breaking point but you continued to live and gain power for five more years, so this cannot be the sole reason for your downfall. In fact, you could have recovered from this solecism  which was necessary for your ascension   if not for what you did next.
 First, you disrespected the Senate in a very public manner. When the Senate formally bestowed honors upon you in the Temple of Venus Genetrix, you refused to rise for them which disgraced them. ...when for [the nobles] own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you, and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him (Machiavelli, IX). You underestimate the power of the Senate and by snubbing them, created a dangerous enemy. Instead, you should have remained humble for as long as possible until you were absolutely sure that your power was secure and even then, you should never create unnecessary enemies. 
Your next mistake lay not in the event itself, but your reaction to it. Two Tribunes removed a diadem that had been placed on your statue. It is unknown whether they put it there in the first place to snub you but it does not matter as the results are the same. The same Tribunes then arrested someone who called out to you as the king. These two events made you highly paranoid and you responded, most rashly, by removing them completely from the Senate. This was a mistake because the Tribunes were seen as a representation of the common people and your removal of them was an attack on the masses. ...one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him (Machiavelli, IX).  Because you oppressed them through their representatives, they were turned against you. This was a fatal error as you had lost the support of both the nobles and the people, which would give your assassins the assurance they needed to dispose of you.  
These two errors combined with further mistakes involving your lack of control over your own ego made you an unwanted ruler. Even though in the end, the Senators underestimated the popularity of your previous reforms, causing the people to rise up against them and favor your successors, this does not erase the fact that you never got the chance to rule absolutely in the way best for an Empire. You should have kept your image as a man of the people and not made the Senators feel threatened. In sacrificing a small portion of your ego, you could have gained absolute power and have done whatever you wanted. I hope in time you will come to see my point of view and the error of your ways. Until that time, I wish you the best.
Yours Truly,
Machiavelli

Macbeth: Gangsta Edition - Write Up
In Macbeth: Gangsta Edition, the setting is a 1930s Italian Crime Family (Mafia) mansion inside the Crime Bosss master bedroom. With modern-day culture being fascinated with the life of a gangster and the Mafia, depicted in popular movies like The Godfather, popular games like Mafia, and even gang life being referenced in popular rap songs, this setting should be extremely engaging to a modern audience (Gen Z).
The basic room plan will include red wallpaper, a chandelier, and curtain-closed windows. Set pieces adjunct to the basic room layout include a luxurious king-sized bed, a portrait of Al Capone above the bed, as well as a painting of a dagger on the wall, a safe hidden in a closet, a desk with scattered papers and stacks of money, and a bedside table with wilting white flowers.
The set itself is meant to allude to the room where Duncan was murdered in the original text. In the set design, the red wallpaper is meant to signify the blood on Macbeths hands after he killed Duncan, with the powerful color intentionally appearing dominant to the viewer's eyes. The red wallpaper is meant to emphasize the morass of weight that Macbeth carries after he murders Duncan in Act 2. Indeed, What hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes./Will all great Neptunes ocean wash this blood/Clean from my hand? (2.2.76-77). Here, Macbeth clearly is shocked at the sight of his hands when he mentions they pluck out mine eyes, and the goal of the red walls is to pluck out the eyes of the viewers as well to better emphasize Macbeths consciousness.
Along with Macbeths desire to become clean, there is also his obsession with his deed staying secret. This can be seen in Act 1 where after Macbeth reveals his desire to kill Duncan, he whispers to himself, Stars, hide your fires;/Let not light see my black and deep desires. (1.4.57-58). In the set design, this aspect of Macbeth will be represented through the use of curtain-closed windows and a hanging chandelier. In the book, the murder of Duncan takes place at night, when the stars are typically shining, so by hiding the room from the stars using curtains, the set alludes to Macbeths desire to hide [the stars] fires (1.4.57). Additionally, to represent Macbeths wish to Let not light see my black and deep desires, the chandelier (a quasi light) will go out at the end of scene 4 to allude to this iconic line.
As for the set pieces themselves, the portrait of Al Capone hung above the bed is meant to reinforce the sets theme of 1930s Mafia, with additional meaning being added with the fact that it is hung above the head of the bed. Since Al Capone was a significant gangster leader/icon, the fact that his portrait is above the bed indicates that whoever sleeps in the bed is also a significant leader/icon (i.e. Duncan). Macbeth himself even mentions Duncans significant leadership as he contemplates killing him. Indeed, this Duncan/Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been/So clear in his great office (1.7.16-18). Here, the phrase Hath borne his faculties so meek refers to Duncans compassionate leadership, and mentioning So clear in his great office alludes to Duncans power. In addition to the portrait of Al Capone, there will be a closet-enclosed safe and desk with scattered papers and stacks of money. These will be located opposite the bed to prevent distracting the audience from Duncans murder scene.
In addition to set pieces that allude to the setting/theme, there are also set pieces that reference Macbeth. The painting of the dagger on the wall is meant to allude to Macbeths famous chimerical hallucination of a dagger pointing to Duncan. To represent this pointing in the set design, the dagger painting will be located adjacent to the bed and the dagger will face the head of the bed, where Duncan will sleep. To the side of the bed will also be a bedside table, holding a vase filled with wilting white flowers. This is meant to reference Lady Macbeths view of Macbeth as too full o th milk of human kindness, which ends up wilting away as Macbeth falls further victim to his desires (1.5.17). The reason why the color white was chosen for the flower is both because white is typically a color that represents purity and goodness, and also because Lady Macbeth explicitly states [she] shame[s]/to wear a heart so white referring to Macbeths goodness (2.2.82-83). As Macbeth kills more and more people, the idea is to have petals fall from the flower one by one until there is only one left. In the final battle scene when the hidebound Macbeth finally dies, the last petal will finally fall.

Lady Macbeth As An Appropriate Tragic Hero
Aristotles Poetics dives deeply into the question of what makes a tragedy truly exceptional, serving to explore and specifically define the subject. The book discusses concepts regarding simple vs. complex plots and the makings of a tragic hero. It defines Greek terms such as anagnorisis and peripeteia in ways understandable to those unfamiliar with the intricacies of Greek theater. The definition of anagnorisis in Greek theater is the recognition in which a character realizes the truth regarding their circumstances, and peripeteia is the reversal in which a characters fate and pre-existing fortune are suddenly reversed. Poetics defines Shakespeares Macbeth as a tragedy. Macbeth is considered a tragic hero on the basis of the fact that his hubris, or heavy sense of pride, is integral to the plot. Additionally, the aforementioned plot devices such as anagnorisis and peripeteia are essential to the storyline. Therefore, the play is subject to scrutiny by Poetics when defining whether or not the storytelling devices employed are effective or not. Lady Macbeth, the wife of the titular character, is portrayed in the play as more masculine than her husband primarily to create a juxtaposition between the two. The definitions of masculine and feminine can be subjective in the context of Shakespeare, as they are primarily societal roles, but Shakespeare makes frequent comparisons to masculinity as equating to war or cruelty, and femininity as equating to being maternal and loving. The aforementioned juxtaposition goes on to portray Macbeth, the play's tragic hero, as weaker or significantly more feminine than the other men and even his own wife. Aristotles Poetics defines appropriateness as a necessary characteristic for a character to have within a tragedy. A characters appropriateness in an Aristotelian context relates to their station and role in life, and whether or not they behave in such a manner appropriate to this station or role. As Lady Macbeth does not behave in a way typical for a woman, in an attempt to make her husband seem to behave in a way atypical for a man, Aristotles argument would mean that Lady Macbeth as a character is fundamentally flawed by Aristotelian standards. However, her masculine behavior and the characteristics that cause her to be such an inappropriate woman go on to further the plot. Both Lady Macbeths feminine and masculine qualities are essential to the storyline of Macbeth, proving that Aristotles definition of the necessity of appropriateness to a plot is not always true.
	Lady Macbeths masculine tendencies, in this instance meaning her penchant for violence and willingness to do what needs to be done for her and her husband to succeed, are necessary for the advancement of the plot. Throughout the course of the play, but especially leading up to the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeths character is shown to be distinctly more masculine than that of her husband. The choice to do this on Shakespeares part is very obviously purposeful and meant to be acknowledged by both the audience and Lady Macbeth herself, as she even states in a monologue after learning that the witches prophesied that her husband would become king. She prays that supernatural powers will make her more masculine, even asking the spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full/Of direst cruelty [...] Come to my womans breasts/And take my milk for gall, you murdring ministers (Shakespeare 1.5.48-55). Lady Macbeths desire and motivation to kill Duncan is the only reason why he dies, as she believes that Macbeth himself is not able to do it because his nature is too full o th milk of human kindness/To catch the nearest way (Shakespeare 1.5.17-18). Lady Macbeths more masculine characteristics and actions serve an equally beneficial role in the plot of Macbeth as that of her feminine characteristics and actions. It is arguable that the murder of Duncan is the most essential event to the plot of the play, as it results in Macbeths eventual downfall, and this event was furthered almost purely by Lady Macbeths actions.
	It is not only Lady Macbeths masculine traits that contribute to the overarching plot of the play, seeing as her feminine traits also contribute to the tragic value of the plays events. Lady Macbeths slow descent into insanity in the latter acts of the play proves that she has additional importance to the story. She doesnt only act as a contrasting device to better showcase her husbands lack of masculinity, but her state of delusion and vivid hallucinations towards the end of the play begin to create the effect of catharsis for the viewer. In the Introduction to the Poetics, the translator Malcolm Heath states that the relief that katharsis brings is pleasurable (Aristotle xxxix). If the experience of Lady Macbeths feelings of anguish or pain brings pleasure to the audience, her expressions of emotion, such as when she asks herself, What, will these hands neer be clean? while hallucinating Duncans blood on her hands, then shes creating a feeling of catharsis for the viewer (Shakespeare 5.1.45). This exacerbates her feminine qualities, as expressions of emotion are traditionally understood to be a more feminine rather than masculine concept. Additionally, Aristotle states that suffering, an action that involves destruction or pain is important to a tragic plot (Aristotle 19). Lady Macbeths intense expression of pain contributes greatly to the tragic plot. Macbeth never really experiences intense bouts of emotional pain on stage in the way that Lady Macbeth does. The plethora of scenes in which she experiences vivid hallucinations and exhibits signs of severe psychological damage because of her own actions provide much more catharsis and clear demonstrations of emotional pain and suffering than Macbeth, whose only real suffering is displayed through physical harm, and the lengths that hes driven to by his ambitions.
	Lady Macbeths duality of both masculine and feminine actions and character traits is innately defiant to Aristotles writings on appropriateness. In Poetics, Aristotle discusses the appropriateness of the actions of various characters based on their station in life. How appropriately a character behaves is determined by their ability to perform the actions commonly attributed to their role. In the instance of Lady Macbeth, Aristotle provides the example that, as for character, there are four things to aim at [...] it is possible for a character to be courageous, but for this to be an inappropriate way for a woman to display courage or cleverness (Aristotle 24). When attempting to create a quality plot with characters that advance the story, Aristotle claims that appropriateness is one of the four most important things to emulate within a tragedy. However, by this metric of appropriateness, Shakespeare does not abide by Aristotles guidelines, creating an inappropriate woman in the form of Lady Macbeth. Yet Lady Macbeths character does not hinder the plot. She furthers it by providing contrast to make the character of Macbeth seem more extreme. Additionally, she brings emotional catharsis to the audience, which brings pleasure, and she moves the plot forward by way of encouraging Macbeth to kill Duncan and become king. As Lady Macbeths lack of appropriateness is only beneficial to the overarching plot of Macbeth, Aristotles claim regarding character is incorrect and not universal.
	Aristotle does not think very highly of the concept of a woman behaving of her own volition, or, as previously stated, displaying traits of courage or cleverness. Perhaps some part of his belief system can be attributed to the social hierarchy of Ancient Greece regarding the roles of women in politics, music, art, theatre, writing, philosophy, etc., but Aristotles writings on the role of women in tragedy throughout the Poetics have been largely exclusionary. To claim that a woman needs to take on an appropriate role in tragedy is to effectively exclude her from the narrative of the story, or to dilute her to play a role only of a wife or a mother, which typically leaves very little room for the complex emotions that are typically so prevalent within tragedy. Lady Macbeths tragic role is unique from other women in tragedy, such as Jocasta, in that Lady Macbeths own emotional pain is personal to herself and her own actions and is not exclusively used as a tool of recognition. Thats not to say that Lady Macbeth is significantly explicated as a character in her own right outside of her marriage to Macbeth. Still, at least the audiences perception of Lady Macbeths emotional pain is not overshadowed, as is Jocastas by her husband-sons recognition and subsequent emotional downfall. Shakespeares unique portrayal of a female character in tragedy, while likely not intended to be feminist in any way, is still a unique and refreshing divergence from the typical watering-down of female characters within classic tragedies as glorified plot devices for the male tragic heroes to either be married to, be sons of, or, in the case of Jocasta, both.

Our Services: Quantifying Let-7 and APL-1
ELISA:
Epoch Inc.
Discover your true age with the power of Let 7 and APL-1 Testing!
What is Let-7?
The Let-7 gene codes for the Let-7 microRNA. First discovered in C.Elegans, the Let 7 gene is expressed more in aging tissues and organelles. The Let-7 microRNA also participates in multiple pathways that regulate the aging process; it affects tissue stem cell function, metabolism, immune function, and aging-related diseases. One such aging-related disease is Alzheimers Disease.
What is APL-1:
Let-7 microRNA controls the regulation of the APL-1 gene. APL- 1 and its homolog APP code for proteins responsible for one of the main components of the brain plaque that causes Alzheimer's Disease. Monitoring APL-1 levels can therefore help inform us of Let-7 expression levels and also help us understand a patient's risk for Alzheimer's.
Why Quantify Let-7 & APL-1?
The expression of Let-7 is very important to quantify and monitor because it can indicate a person's susceptibility to aging-related diseases. This information is vital as it informs the precautions one must take for their health.
Our Techniques:
Why ELISA:
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is a method for detecting and quantifying proteins. We use the ELISA technique to quantify levels of APL-1, the Alzheimer's Amyloid precursor protein in Caenorhabditis elegans related to the human -amyloid precursor protein.
Antigen Detection ELISA Technique:
Bind antigen to the well:
Add the patients sample to the well in a microplate. This sample contains many proteins but might not contain the antigen of interest.
Incubate the sample to allow proteins in the sample to bind through hydrophobic interactions to the plastic well.
Add wash buffer to the well to remove any unbound sample and block the remaining available binding surfaces of the plastic wells. This step prevents anything from binding non-specifically to the wells later in the procedure.
Add primary antibody:
Add primary antibodies specific to the antigen of interest to the wells. If the antigen is present, the primary antibodies will bind to the epitope of the antigen fixed to the bottom of the wells. Incubate the sample.
Add wash buffer to the wells to remove all unbound antibodies (if the primary antibody didnt bind to the antigen, then it will be washed away).
Add secondary antibody:
Add a solution of enzyme-linked secondary antibodies (specific for the Fc region of the primary antibody) to the well. These secondary antibodies come from another animal and bind to the primary antibodies that are present.
Incubate the sample.
Add wash buffer to the wells to remove any unbound secondary antibodies.
Enzyme-Substrate Reaction:
Substrates specific to the enzymes linked to the secondary antibodies are added in each well. If a secondary antibody is present, the interaction between the enzyme on the secondary antibody and the substrate generates color. If there was no antigen, the well will remain clear.
The color can be read with the naked eye or quantified with an electric plate reader.
Supplies Needed:
Quantifying Let-7 Micro RNA: Northern Blot
FISH
Quantifying APL-1 Protein: Indirect Elisa
Genome-Wide:
RNA Sequencing
12-well microplate Patients sample Primary antibody Secondary antibody
Wash buffer
Colorgenic enzyme substrate/chromogen Positive control
Negative control
Example Data:
The blue color indicates that the protein of interest (APL-1) is present (the sample is positive), while no color indicates that APL-1 is not present (the sample is negative). The brighter the color, the more concentrated the target protein is.
Northern Blot	FISH	RNA Sequencing
Northern Blot is a technique used to detect levels of RNA. It is a useful strategy when both presence and quantity of RNA need to be known.
Technique
1)MicroRNA is extracted from cells in a blood or tissue sample by lysing the cell, adding chloroform, ethanol, and eluting the aqueous RNA at the top.
2)The sample is run through gel electrophoresis, separating the microRNA
by size.
3)The gel is transferred to a solid, nylon, positively charged, RNA-binding membrane through blotting. The capillary blotting system involves a transfer buffer to lower temperature, and weights, paper towels, and a blotting paper above the gel membrane. The results of the gel are drawn upwards into the nylon membrane. The two are linked together by UV light.
4)Separately, a special fluorescent tag is added to an LNA probe. The LNA probe is a modified DNA probe where the 2 oxygen is locked and attached to the 4 carbon. This probe is more sensitive to microRNA than a DNA probe.
5)The LNA Probe with tag attached is hybridized to the RNA on the membrane.
6)The probe glows when in contact with microRNA and is visible through
X-ray. Densitometry can find concentration levels, which denote more or less microRNA. The placement on the gel denotes base pair size.
Supplies Needed:
-Patient Sample, Lysis and Binding Buffer, Chloroform, Ethanol, Elution Buffer, Electrophoresis Machine and Gel, Positively charged nylon membrane, Transfer
RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a tool to detect, localize, and quantify RNAs of interest in the cell.
Technique
1.Sample Fixation and Permeabilization:
a.Kill normal life functions in the cell tissue and stabilize the structure of the tissue using 4% paraformaldehyde (fixation).
b.Use detergent (Tween-20) to dissolve lipids from cell membranes and thereby make the cells RNA accessible to the hybridization probes.
2.Probe Hybridization:
a.Oligonucleotide probes complementary to the RNA sequence of interest and tagged with a fluorescent label are applied to the fixed and permeabilized sample in solution. Diffusion kinetics allows for probes to enter the cell.
b.Specialized hybridization buffers are used to increase the chances of successful probe binding.
c.Incubate the cell with the probes.
3.Washing:
a.Washes move from higher to lower salt concentration and from lower to higher temperature to remove nonspecifically bound probes and background signal.
4.Imaging:
a.Signals are visualized using fluorescent microscopy.
Supplies Needed:
Paraformaldehyde

RNA sequencing both sequences and quantifies expression levels of RNA across the whole transcriptome. We can use the data collected from RNA sequencing to determine if the Let-7 gene is turned on or off and what its level of transcription is.
Technique:
1.RNA Extraction: Isolate the microRNA by lysing the cell, adding chloroform and ethanol, and eluting the aqueous RNA at the top.
2.Reverse transcription: Use reverse transcriptase to convert the single-
stranded RNA into more stable, double-stranded cDNA (complementary DNA).
3.Adapted ligation: Add sequencing adaptors to each end of the fragments. These adaptors contain functional elements which allow the sequencing machine to recognize the fragments and allow different samples to be sequenced at the same time
4.Amplification: PCR amplify the library. Only the fragments with sequencing adaptors are amplified.
5.Sequencing: The sequencing machine attaches probes to the first base in
each fragment. Each probe has a color associated with a certain nucleotide. The machine repeats with each following nucleotide sequence, taking pictures as it works to record the color.
6.Compare: The highest quality reads from the sequencing are aligned next to a known sequence, and counted. The difference between a genome and a

Northern Blot VS. FISH
Although Northern Blot and FISH are both methods to detect RNA, they vary in purpose. Northern Blot can be used to detect the presence and quantity of RNA in a sample. This is useful if you are testing for any presence of Let-7, or testing for how much Let-7 is in a certain sample. This would be useful if you wanted to quantify the difference between Let-7 expression in children and adults. FISH, on the other hand, can also give visual cues to indicate where in the cell the RNA is. This is useful in testing for the Let-7 microRNA because the location can indicate which pathways the Let-7 is involved in. For example, a FISH test for Let-7 microRNA could show a positive result on the chromosomal location of the APL-1 gene, indicating that the microRNA is active on the APL-1 gene at that time.Saint Petersburg Review

Op Ed: On the state of St. Petersburg
Saint Petersburg, its a lovely city. Lots of nice architecture, good bars, and the most recent ideas. However we have had some problems here recently. There has been an uptick in deaths, including one of our dear citizens to a carriage.11 We need to be cautious, and with this, also be more vigilant. Without everyone working together, we could descend into a city of crime. We need to act as one, and prevent this fine city from taking a downturn. We need to take care of our neighbors, and like Ive seen one person do, despite being borderline destitute himself, offering to pay for a womans ride who desperately needed it to get home safely12. That is an example of kindness that this city needs. If even one percent of everyone acted as generous as he did, this city would be one of the best to live in in the entirety of Russia. So we need to keep together, and keep helping each other like wed want to be helped ourselves. Only together can we make Saint Petersburg a better place.

Business review: Alyonas Pawn Shop1
Rating: Two stars
This pawn shop has a nice location in Saint Petersburg, however, it isnt the best organized. The trinkets are everywhere and rather expensive. However the worst part is dealing with the owner Alyona. Working with her is so infuriating, that you could just strangle her. She offers way less than what other dealers would, and her terms on the loan if you want to buy your item back are extreme. Personally I would say avoid this place unless youre desperate.
Begin essay one
	This piece is on the subject of crime. With crime comes morals, and there are two kinds of crime, legal and moral. With legal crime, there are the laws of a nation, city,or state and breaking them entails punishment. There are also moral crimes, which are violations of the moral code. With these, the punishment is self-inflicted, with the effect of the punishment not being on ones physical life, but ones mental wellbeing. There are two classes of people in this world, the ordinary, and the extraordinary. Society should be divided by those two groups, with the ordinary ... material serving solely for the purpose of reproducing the species.2 The ordinary are just a class of people that only exist since the species needs them for numbers, and not because they give anything meaningful to society. Theyre those who would have to do things like manual labor, and other menial tasks that the other group, the extraordinaries, shouldnt have to do. Meanwhile the extraordinary people contain ...those who possess the gift or talent of uttering some new word in their milieu.3. These extraordinary people are the rulers, the thinkers of society, and to have society advance, they need to be catered to. This ties into the laws as well. The ordinary people should be beholden to all laws, because since they would not make any meaningful contributions to society, they would need to be restricted, so society could get the maximum benefit from those who are extraordinary.  However, with the extraordinary people,  that is, not that theyre able, but who have every right to commit any kind of outrages and crimes, and that the laws do not apply to them.4  This is because those people need to not have any barriers to contributing to society. The extraordinary people are those who build society up, and allow us to transcend the current state to a new one, for example Newton or Napoleon. For example In my opinion, if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could in no way have become known to people other than through the sacrifice of the lives of one, ten, a hundred, and so on people who interfered with their discoveries Newton had the right, and was even obligated to  eliminate those ten or a hundred people in order to make his discoveries known to all humanity.5 This is because if the ordinary person gets in the way of the extraordinary, theyre blocking societys progress. As a society, crime should be justifiable and almost necessary if its to advance society as a whole. Since laws exist to protect society, they should be broken to advance society as a whole, and those who are advancing society shouldnt have to worry about them at all. As a society, progress is what matters, and I think it should be obtained no matter the cost. However the extraordinary person would probably feel remorse about the harm done to make progress. Just because someone should be in the right both legally and morally, that doesnt mean they wont put a burden on themselves. However the lamentation of ones actions is part of their life, and with that, they might say something like I killed myself, not the old woman!6 The burden of their actions might just harm them more than it should, because even if they act in the greater good, they will feel they did wrong. That is just part of human nature, for both the ordinary and the extraordinary. So even if they have every right to do what they did, it would be normal for them to feel remorse. With the two groups of people, the ordinary and the extraordinary, there should be two standards, so that society as a whole can progress. The only burdens on the progress made by the extraordinary should be those that are self inflicted, since justice should recognize progress.
Begin Essay 2
Raskolnikov, I believe that there shouldnt be an ordinary and extraordinary class of people. You talk about how there is both legal and moral crime. That is true, I will give you that. However legal crime should be heavily enforced. Without it, we wouldnt be a society, but a bunch of people fighting each other. And also, according to you, and your beliefs on the ordinary versus the extraordinary, Ordinary people must live in obedience and do not have the right to overstep the law, because, dont you see, theyre ordinary. But extraordinary people have the right to commit all sorts of crimes and to overstep precisely because theyre extraordinary.7 If extraordinary people were breaking every law, we might as well not have any laws to begin with. Laws exist to protect the populace just as much as they do to keep them in order. And if an extraordinary person breaks those laws, their findings would take longer to be accepted, if theyre accepted at all. Correct me if Im wrong, but if Newton killed someone to get his findings published, they would probably be disregarded, until someone else, who didnt violate the laws, came to the same conclusion. However, if youre correct, Of course, Im prepared to bow down before them, but youll agree, it would be terrible if there were very many of them, wouldnt it?8 If there were tons of people who were extraordinary, there might as well not be any laws. We could accept were ordinary, and follow the law, and be heavily restricted. But I am very sure that some people would call themselves extraordinary and use that to their advantage, and hinder society as a whole. With this designation, the idea of not letting laws pertain to the extraordinary, wouldnt progress society but hinder it. And you might think that after all this, and with this essay ... that you might also have considered yourself, even the tiniest bit, to be an extraordinary man uttering some new word, in the sense that youre using it9 However extraordinary is determined by history not by those with any new discoveries. Some discoveries are irrelevant to society, or outright wrong, so why should people get to be above others over something insignificant? Besides, after all, ... who among us in Holy Rus doesnt consider himself a Napoleon these days?10 If everyone considered themselves extraordinary, nobody would be. Extraordinary means to be above the average by a lot, and I know that everyone wants to call themselves above average, so that would just raise the average instead. With the whole situation, it would be much better to hold everyone, extraordinary or not, to the confines of the law, and then let the historians sort out who is extraordinary and who isnt.

On Crime by Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov
How is it that the most horrible atrocities are performed? How can any man stomach the murder of innocents by his own hands? The truth is, he cannot, at least not sanely. Most people who commit a crime become infected by a psychological illness, both before and after the crime has been committed. Anyone who escapes this illness is another type of man altogether who was put on this Earth for humanitys progression. 
 It must be stated that for the purposes of this article, we are focusing on murder and other similarly horrendous acts.  Although it may seem crude, we must admit that the majority of people consists of conservative people by nature, well-behaved, who live in obedience and like being obedient. In my opinion, theyre even obligated to be obedient because that is their destiny, and theres nothing humiliating about it for them.[1] They are always men of the present'' and their goal is to preserve the world and increase its population.[2]  We must examine how any ordinary man could come to the decision to commit a crime in the first place, as this certainly occurs, In spite of their inborn inclination to obey, by a certain playfulness of nature, not denied even to a cow, an extremely large number of them like to imagine themselves advanced people. But in my opinion, there can be no real danger herebecause these people never get very far. Of course, they can sometimes be beaten for their fervor, as to remind them of their rightful place, but nothing more. You dont even need anyone to carry out the punishment: theyll beat themselves up because they are so well behaved. Some will provide this service to others, and some will do it to themselves They impose various public punishments on themselves and it turns out beautifully and instructive.[3] Most peoples natural desire to fit in with humanity and behave conservatively will, in the end, overpower their desire to promote their own wants through crime or any satisfaction they gained as a result of their crime. This is simply the nature of the world, and it is a good thing, as the stability of the majority has allowed our species to exist for so many years. 
Finally, it is time to address the few men who are altogether unaffected by the psychological sufferings of crime, those we call the extraordinaries. In short, extraordinary men are Those who possess the gift or talent of uttering some new word in their milieu.[4] Their purpose in life is to move the world forward and lead it to its goal.[5] It would quickly become a problem if there were too many men trying to move the world forward as they would no doubt come into conflict with each other and in the end, get nowhere. It is lucky that, In general, an unusually small number of people are born, and even strangely few, with a new idea, or who are capable of even uttering something new.[6] Now before the entire world breaks out in panic, I dont insist in any way that extraordinary people must and are always obligated to commit all sorts of outragesI merely imply that the extraordinary man has the rightthat is, not the official right, but he himself has the right to permit his conscience to overstepvarious obstacles, and only in the case that the execution of his idearequires it.[7] While this may seem a shocking idea, let us look into the past to those who changed the world forever. At least the lawgivers and trailblazers of humanity, beginning with the ancients, continuing with Lycurgus, the Solons, Mohammeds, Napoleons, and so forth, each and every one of them, were criminals, just by the virtue of the fact that in propagating new laws, they were at the same time destroying the old laws viewed as sacred by society and handed down by their fathers.[8] These individuals shed innocent blood and had many enemies when they were alive, but are now venerated and revered. To be clear, it is not that extraordinary men are heartless: Pain and suffering are always obligatory for someone with broad intellect and deep feeling. Truly great individuals, it seems to me, must experience great sorrow in the world.[9] Rather, it is that their pain is necessary for the progression of humanity. It is the extraordinary mans solemn duty, given by nature, to change the world, no matter what it takes. 
In summary, any crime committed by an ordinary man is the result of a psychological illness that will become his downfall and reveal his criminal acts to all. In contrast, the few extraordinary men avoid this illness because their crimes are done for the sake of the new word, which is vital to humanity as a whole. I hope these words will be taken most seriously, as history strongly supports this idea even though they seem appalling. 
In Response to On Crime by Porfiry Petrovich
My friend, Rodion Romanovich, has argued above that crime is a disease that plagues the mind of the criminal. While this is fascinating in and of itself, his argument that there are certain people above all laws is a most original idea. In light of recent events, I would like to take another look at his essay and offer my own humble opinion. 
On Crimes main folly was that it claimed men are capable of escaping guilt. Truly, all men are of the same fundamental nature and will succumb to it no matter how clever they may be. Let us consider one of these few elites. A young person, carried away by his own wit, overstepping all obstacles... never even thinks about [human nature]. Lets suppose that he, that is, this man, our special cases,... will lie brilliantly, in the cleverest way; this might seem to be a triumph, and he could enjoy the fruits of his wit, but, all of a sudden, bang, he falls into a faint in the most interesting and scandalous place. He lied incomparably well, but he couldnt rely on his own nature.Another time, distracted by the playfulness of his wit, hell begin to make fun of the man who suspects him; hell grow pale, as if on purpose, as if playing a game, but he grows pale in a too natural a way, too much like it was the truth, and once again hes suggested an idea![10] This is the downfall of all men who believe themselves to be beyond nature, it will claim them in the end. Nature will conquer all, even the smuggest and most clever of men. There are none meant to rule the world and usher in new words, it is all just luck and circumstances. 
Rodion Romanovichs second error was that he assumed he could make himself into an extraordinary man. Even if his little theory were true (which I can barely fathom), he never had what it took to embody whatever innate prowess the extraordinary may have. It is always telling when a places himself at the top of his theory about humanity. While Rodion Romanovich never directly claimed to be one of the highest men[11], who among us in the Holy Rus doesnt consider himself a Napoleon these days? [12]And, nevertheless, he did admit to thinking of himself as extraordinary when I pressed him directly.[13] Of course, as we all know from the recent news, even Rodion Romanovich himself could not escape human nature, as it ate him away until he relented to confession. If the great envisioner of this system himself could not become extraordinary, who among us could even dream of changing the world through force and conviction? The idea only leads to misplaced pride and, ultimately, to great suffering. 
Now that dear Rodion Romanovich is suffering for his crime, I can only hope it will cleanse him of the guilt that he tried to, most foolishly, escape from. He is truly an intelligent man with deep, hidden compassion. In his new life, I pray he will productively use his cleverness for the betterment of all.

Essay on Role of Education
In order to fully answer the question of how to achieve the ideal education system, we must first define what an ideal education entails, and how this educational model will contribute to a better society. Does a more equitable education lead to a more equal society, and should that even be the goal? Such questions have been plaguing philosophers for centuries, from ancient Greece to present day. Based on the diversity of educational models around the world, it is clear that we have yet to come up with a definitive answer, and empirical evidence seems to show that education systems reflect back the values of their given societies. Thus, to answer this question of education, I will first define an ideal society, then explain how an education system can lead to that goal.
My understanding of an ideal society is one that permits freedom of thought and promotes education to all people. I will admit that I am biased towards western ideas of freedom and education, as they were laid out by Socrates, because I was born in the United States, and come from a European background. If I was born in a more homogenous, collectivist society perhaps my framework for freedom would be different. However, I believe that the fundamental freedoms of press and speech, rights to assemble and to question our government must form the basis of an ideal society. Such a society would be more akin to a democracy, which Socrates warns of, due to its tendency to lead people into submitting themselves to the views of a candidate who could later morph into a tyrant. I want to push back on Socrates idea of an ideal society, because it focuses more on the knowledge and wisdom of the king or ruling class than the ideals and rights of the general population. A wise and just ruler is indeed a key component to creating an ideal society, but by placing too much emphasis on the ruler, there is little protection of the people, in case this ruler becomes tyrannical and unjust (a powerful ruler with strong convictions can often end up on the opposite side of his original ideas). Socrates claims in the Republics sixth book that until the philosopher class gains mastery of a city, there will be no respite from evils for either city or citizens, and the constitution we have been describing in our discussion will never be completed in practice. This paints a very black and white picture of the necessity of having a philosopher king, and I wouldnt trust an unchecked class of people to run a government, with minimal involvement from the general public. Socrates' discussion on the proper model of education is based on how to cultivate wise, virtuous leaders with the ultimate goal of creating a ruling class. However, the glaring problem in this model is that even these highly educated people are susceptible to greed and corruption which would set the entire system off balance, because (according to Socrates) this ruling class is the most virtuous and wise, and the citizens are generally not due to lack of education. All this to say, that an ideal society would have power spread more equally across the population, thus necessitating a more egalitarian education system. 
As for the method and structure of education, the Socratic method, which promotes questioning and disregarding previous assumptions, would be beneficial in creating an educated and thoughtful society. Because the youth will learn to regularly question facts and opinions, they will be more resistant to tactics of brainwashing and manipulation coming from the government. Societies with governments that need strict cooperation from its citizens, whether because of war, economic prospects, or any other reason, value timeliness, rote memorization and rigid structure in their education system. By discouraging self-discovery and avoiding examination of pertinent topics, this generation will be more likely to accept their role prescribed by society, instead of questioning its fundamental structure. This is opposite of what an ideal society should be; one that encourages its people to question the actions of leaders and speak up. To aid the youth in finding the truth for themselves, Socrates encourages a more free and individualized education, stating, calculation, geometry, and all the preparatory education that serves as preparation for dialectic must be offered to them in childhoodand not in the shape of compulsory instruction [...] no compulsory instruction remains in the soul. He also believes in letting children discover their calling through play instead of pushing a certain career onto them. This is the method that public education should adopt, and is in the best interest of the general public. 
However, this system is not in the benefit of the government because as I explained, it is harder to persuade and unify a more diverse, skeptical population than a uniform, loyal population. Another problem that may arise is that by moving towards a less standardized curriculum, it may be difficult to come to any consensus and enact change due to conflicting viewpoints and lack of an established knowledge base. Allan Bloom, an American academic, explained that he spoke against removing class requirements in universities because this core curriculum was a threadbare reminiscence of the unity of knowledge and provided an obstinate little hint that there are some things one must know about if one is to be educated. This idea of what an educated person must know is very subjective, so although I do not agree with his view I dont fully disagree because it depends on the specific classes he is proposing are essential. In conclusion, although a more Socratic, free  education model is beneficial to the individual, it can bring difficulties during times of unity and create more friction within society.  
As to the question of how to achieve such a system of education, pedagogy and quality of teachers would need to be a priority, and thus this profession must be desirable in society. The fact that a man who famously said that he knows nothing, is seen as one of the greatest teachers in history, shows that ideal teachers must have a self awareness of their position in relation to their students, as a person through which students should ultimately learn more about themselves. In a practical sense, there is not one way to run this type of education model, and it will depend on the time and context.

The Inescapable Spiral of Fear
Every person experiences fear as a part of being human. But when the fear of having our self-image shattered becomes the driving force behind all our actions, it can drag us into becoming what we fear most. According to Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, every tragedy stems from one fatal error, known as hamartia. He wrote, It follows that a well-formed plot [ ]must involve a change[]from good fortune to bad fortune  and this must be due not to depravity but to a serious error (Poetics 21). Sophocless Oedipus the King follows such a pattern. Oedipus, who has become king after saving Thebes from a Sphynx as the previous king, Laius, was murdered on the road, marries the widowed queen Jocasta. From a prophet, Oedipus learns that the plague, which is wreaking havoc on his kingdom, will end only when Laiuss killer is brought to justice. Both he and Jocasta had separately heard prophecies that they strove to avoid. While seeking to uncover the killer, Oedipus discovered that both he and Jocasta are vassals of their joint prophecies. Eventually, Oedipus realizes that Jocasta is his true mother and the stranger Oedipus has killed on the road is Laius, his father, fulfilling both the prophecies. Oedipuss Aristotelian error is not so much his killing his father or marrying his mother or even his obliviousness as it is a psychological failing that appears repeatedly, driving him to discover the truth that dooms him. The root cause of Oedipuss downfall is his need to defend his worldview, which holds that he evaded his fate through moral actions and is secure in his rule. Oedipuss fear of being wrong makes him insecure in his worldview and so he tries to get others to assure him before dismissing them entirely at any form of criticism.
Towards the beginning, Oedipus learns that the only way to stop the plague is to bring Laiuss murder to justice. Oedipus pesters the prophet Tiresias to reveal the killers identity. Tiresias hesitates but finally names Oedipus as the killer. This declaration threatens Oedipus and awakens his fear. He pressures Tiresias to repeat himself and, upon hearing the same statement, dismisses Tiresiass validity as a prophet. Oedipuss fear of being a person who would commit such evil as killing a king triggers his outward anger and hidebound attitude. Oedipus lashes out at Tiresias saying, OEDIPUS: Out with it again! TIRESIAS: I say you are the murderer you hunt. OEDIPUS: That obscenity, twice  by god, youll pay. TIRESIAS: Shall I say more, so you can really rage? OEDIPUS: Much as you want. Your words are nothing  futile (Oedipus 411-7). Tiresias states that Oedipus is a murderer because this goes directly against Oedipuss view of himself, and he panics and launches obloquy at him. If his reaction were merely based on his needing to be right, Oedipus would have calmly shut Tiresias down because there would be no threat to his position. The rashness and abruptness reflected in his voice are symptomatic of the panic in his head.  Oedipus hunts for the truth, but upon hearing an opinion that casts him as evil, invalidates the speaker entirely. In truth, his fear of being an immoral and discredited person in the eyes of his subjects causes him to act as such, bullying and discrediting those around him. He will turn to other characters in a vain attempt to soothe his fears and confirm what he wishes to believe, only to be driven to further distress as the play progresses. 
Oedipus, now unsatisfied with Tiresiass prophecy, turns the blame towards Creon, his brother-in-law, and uncle, who sent Tiresias. Oedipus accuses Creon of treason, which Creon rebuffs, telling Oedipus to check his anger. Oedipus then dismisses Creons criticisms by calling in his own position in the hierarchy as king, stating that he is above any criticism. Oedipus needs Creon to be treacherous for Tyresiuss accusations to be wrong to prove that Oedipus is safe from his fears. CREON: Look, if you think crude, mindless stubbornness such a gift, youve lost your sense of balance. OEDIPUS: If you think you can abuse a kinsman, then escape the penalty, youre insane (Oedipus 615-8). Again, Oedipuss emotional reaction gives away his fear. Without the fear that Creon may be right, Oedipus could have dismissed his claims and approached the situation calmly. Truly, it is his insecurity in his own beliefs rather than his stubbornness that prompts this rash response. Oedipus invokes his pride to rebuff Creons criticism because he fears that if Creon is right about his mental state, Tiresias must be right about him being a murderer, which would shatter his self-image as seen by how fragile his mental state becomes at merely the idea. Oedipuss fear is so great that he will turn on his close allies and friends and accuse them of horrible motivations before he looks inwards to see whether others warnings or criticisms have merit. Fear turns him into this tyrant that pushes those who are trying to help him away, which will eventually leave him alone to finally grasp the truth of his situation. 
Oedipus then turns to Jocasta in search of answers. As they each are apprised of more details about the others past, Jocasta begins to suspect the truth: that Oedipus killed Laius and is her son. She tries to stop him from searching for answers, but he is so caught up in his own view of things that he cannot suspect what she knows and throws her off. Jocasta is driven by hubris, which has led her to believe she could escape fate by killing her child and consider divination a sham. When specific elements of their stories match, Jocasta makes the corollary before Oedipus because her fear stems not from being wrong, but from losing the status quo. Oedipus, now reacting from an emotional fight response, cannot comprehend why Jocasta would want to obfuscate the truth and pushes onwards while alienating himself from one of his final allies.  JOCASTA: Oh no, listen to me, I beg you, dont do this. OEDIPUS: Listen to you? No more. I must know it all, must see the truth at last (Oedipus 1168-9). Oedipuss dismissal of his own wife, the person he should trust most, shows how insidious his fear has become. Unlike Tireseius, Jocasta begs Oedipus to trust his initial perception and leave his fear behind. If Oedipus were merely hubristic, he would accept Jocastas pleas and continue his life unflustered. When he tells Jocasta that he must know all, he reveals his fear of being wrong.  Oedipuss need to confirm his reality out of his fear of the truth blinds him and causes him to lash out at the people close to him who attempt to give him a way to live peacefully.  Because he is blinded by fear, he does not listen to the advice of others, even to someone as close as his wife. He charges forward, desperate to confirm what he wants his reality to be. Without anyone left to temper him and offer an escape, Oedipus is left to continue angrily pushing forwards and eventually ends up exposing his worst fears. 
Oedipus so desperately wants to be seen as a virtuous and just king to hold onto his power. The very idea that he could lose his power terrifies him and in emotional knee-jerk reactions, he attempts to confirm his reality and silence any other opinion. In the end, every action he takes toward this goal leads to the confirmation of his worst fear and strips him of all power.  This core error resonates because we are all self-centered animals. We pity Oedipus because, like him, we are so trapped in our individual view of the world that any perspective that undermines our perception, especially if it threatens our social standing, is utterly terrifying. Even though the audience can see the truth of Oedipuss horrible deeds long before he realizes it himself, this pity does not diminish because we, as humans, feel an affinity with his fear and how he sees the world. Oedipus should be read as a cautionary tale about fear. From this story, we should hurry to look inwards and confront the areas of our lives that are motivated by fear. Throughout our lifetimes, we all face criticism which can be especially hard to take if we are told we are the root of our problems. Instead of taking out this fear on the other person, we should try to step outside ourselves and examine whether our internal fear of having something undesired confirmed is the source of our anger. Even though Oedipuss destiny was fait accompli, his story should direct us to take a hard look inwards and reconcile ourselves with the harsh truths we may be avoiding, or doom ourselves to an equally harsh fate.

In a journaling style, reflect on what This is Water Links to an external site. means, what it might mean to how you leave high school, and how you might engage with its lessons in your arch and gallery projects.
Earlier in the reading the first word that came to mind was sonder. That is, the recognition that you are not the main character of the universe. This word speaks to one of the main themes of the talk which was awarenessthis is one of my arch stones, evenin that awareness requires active thought, as opposed to passive thought. This same active thought is what is required to change your default thinking, to push yourself to not grovel. Another idea that came to mind when I was reading this was habit-formation. Wallace recognizes that trying to actively not be self-centered is incredibly difficult, yet, as someone, like Wealth of Nations Adam Smith who thinks that laziness can be a source of innovation, I think that the desire to make difficult things easier is good. This is the primary reason why I like keyboards and human input devices and peripherals of all varieties, because it makes the task of working with a computer easier. So, if we can somehow turn our default settings from a place of self-centeredness, through the crucible that is habit-formation, into one that is more considerate of our tiny place in our social habitats, in our universe, than we may perhaps reap the benefits of mindfulness: gratitude and happiness and such
Another point that I engaged with was being a prisoner to what you worship. We are so self absorbed that, if we worship A, yet someone else is better than us at A, we will believe that we are insufficient at A. While Wallace didnt include the second person as the benchmark of success, I think that interpersonal competition is very often a driving factor for humans. To what end, I am not surejust like in the Hegelian master-slave dialectic, if you eventually become the master of all others, that is, others believe you to be the master, you will wind up becoming the slave to those others because what you seek is recognition for being the best to assure yourself of your position. Anyway, we can worship A and still never be satisfied with our performance in the area. I think, in actionable and pragmatic terms, that we shouldnt stop worshiping A, because it might be that A gives us purpose in our livesthat being said, there might be a distinction between worshiping intelligence and having a goal to learn lots of, say, math, for instance. Yet, worshiping a knowledge of math still produces feelings of inadequacy with respect to that content area. So, the dualityor dialectical whatever, in Hegels or Lacans termsof purpose is that we are both guided by itto happiness, in Frankls mindbut also to servitude and oppression. Yet, I dont yet feel comfortable giving up my worship of math. I find it so paramount to my being, my existence, my meaning, that it seems worship is that proper term. Perhaps a scaled-back version of worshiping is betterits easy to think in extremes. Im not yet convinced that feeling inadequate is wholly a bad thing too. Perhaps a lack of satisfaction is required in order to achieve satisfaction in the future. A world without sadness has no happiness. If everybody is the best at A, no one is the best at A. Zero sum games. Absolutes. Extremes. This line of thinking harms everyone, especially when progresson the scale of humankindrequires collaboration and not competition. Whether or not our state of nature is as an individual, or as a group, we are social animals that wind up in groups somehow, and we cannot exist in absolutesfor only the Sith deal in absolutes. And we all like to think ourselves as the Jedi heroes of the story, of our world. Perhaps then a proper sonder would permit us, like Raskolnikov, to sometimes be obsessed to ill ends with one area, to worship math and feel inadequate, to think that there can only be one best mathematicianalas, I dont think humans live long enough to become polymaths anymorebecause that will allow you to frame your life in a direction. With direction and purpose, you can be motivated to do the difficult initially, create habits, such that you can reap the rewards, act mindfully, later.Part 1, Chapter 6

Dinah
Oh, Francis Sancher. I pray the good lord forgive me for the hate I feel for that horrible, beautiful, hunk of a man1 lying dead before us. I wont waste my breath on telling you all what you already know, of his sordid affairs and peculiar fears, or about the beauty and strength that blesses him even now, dead in his coffin2. Instead, I feel that I have something to confess, a matter that has been weighing upon my heart and mind for some time. For I have done a terrible injustice to Mira, who I love like a daughter, and I should hope to come clean to her and beg of her forgiveness for my sin. I too have shared the bed of Francis Sancher, and when I heard that he had left with Mira, I was overcome with a terrible jealousy. I pray that you do not find me vindictive, but you must understand that Francis Sancher had been my only sanctuary from the coldness of my husband, who left me alone in the house like a corpse in a tomb, veins frozen over and left to petrify3. Miras disappearance robbed me of that last succor I had remaining. So I cursed her, called down misfortune on her4, only to find that Satan had his ears far closer to my mouth than God. So you see, it was my fault that Mira became pregnant through him, my fault that the poor girl had to endure the poisons and cruelties he laid upon her after he learned of her pregnancy. I will spare you the details, as that tale is Miras and not mine to tell, but I will say that I have never heard of a man more frightened of his own seed than Francis Sancher5. I think a terrible curse was on him, far stronger than the one I laid upon Mira. Regardless, that is my confession, and I hope, Mira, you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
	Some of you may find it odd that I address this confession to Mira, and not to my husband, who I have wronged by my adultery and infidelity. I will not have you believe that I dont feel guilty about my actions, but my mind is dogged by that most terrible question Francis Sancher asked of me. Why do we put up with it?6 I have been lying awake at night pondering it, the reasons why I still lived in this tomb of a house with a man I do not love and who does not love me. For a time I had thought it faith that had kept me bound, but I do not believe that to be true now. I believe Faith is what shall set me free. Francis has now been likened in my head to a mare among Pharaohs chariot horses.7 pushing me onward from Egypt to the difficult freedom of the desert, but lost in the sea when the waves come crashing down behind me. I suppose this is to say, Lou-Lou, that I am leaving you. I need to search for my light, my life elsewhere. Goodbye.

For my object, I am selecting a copy of the Tanakh, containing the book of Psalms, among others. I would have preferred a christian copy of the Bible, but that is not something that I possess. Dinah is consistently shown to be a religious individual, blaming herself for calling Satan down on Mirah4 and ending the book by opening Psalms, which I think is the strongest association with an object in the text.7 Additionally, the Messianic connotations foisted on Sancher in the final chapter(could he be an envoy, the messenger of some supernatural force pg. 208) help support his connection with the bible.

I didnt really know the man all that well, truth be told. I dont indulge in the gossip of Riviere au sel and I care little for how many girls bellies had been made to swell up by Francis Sancher1, so his antics never really landed in this thick old skull. Still, as I reckon I may have been the last to see the poor bastard alive2, exceptin the killer of course, if thats what happened, and as I am a damn fine storyteller, I suppose I owe all of you a story.3
	So gather round, and Ill tell you a tale bout the death of Francis Sancher, and the fell curse that dogged his family. I was wandering along the Saint Charles forest path4, when I was distracted from my usual route by this sound of heavy breathing Huughh, Huugh, Huughh. Naturally, I was intrigued, so I wandered towards the sound. Arriving, I see Francis Sancher, sitting on a stump and breathing these deep heavy breaths. So I sidled up to him and asked him what was up, what he was doing there. He just told me to sit down and offered me some rum, which I declined. That stuff was strong, the kind that bowls you over if your head isnt screwed on tight to both shoulders5, and I wasnt quite ready for that. But thats when things get strange, you see, he looks up at the volcano and says I wish it would erupt, that volcano!6, starts talking about not being the only one to go. Now Im scared, so I start blabbing about some nonsense, and I try to change the subject, asking about where hes from. Big mistake, because then he talks about his great-grandfather, Francois Desire7. I shudder now, thinking about what he said about this man8. It seemed he trafficked in dark things, demons and witchcraft and all that the Lord forbids us. He only left his native France after completing his dark work there. The French police found his ritual chamber later, strewn with most of the body of a young woman, though they never did find her head. Of course, by the time this happened, Francois had already wound up in these islands, letting his foulness soak into the sugar and sands, turning them rotten and sharp. But evil never wins in the end, and whatever vileness caught up with him and ended him, and his son, and his grandson, and now Francis sat there awaiting his fate.
	All this talk sent my teeth rattling9, but what really sent me over the edge was the apparition that appeared faintly in the forest just beyond. She was a Negress with pearly-white teeth sparkling between her thick lips, the color of black beauty aubergine, swaying her hips seductively10, and though her beauty made me want to run to her, I knew in my heart that she was death, and to do so would be last thing I ever do. So Im not ashamed to say I ran, and kept running until I saw the safety of my home. But I remember looking back, and seeing Francis Sancher looking at death, and calmly taking a sip from his flask of rum.

I am inferring from this, and the fact he tells tales for a living, that he has a tendency to embellish his stories. As such, the rest of my essay will not necessarily match up with the exact happenings in the text, as he adds little details with each retelling.

For Cyrilles' object, I am bringing a fake bottle of rum. Cyrille does not have a particularly strong connection with Francis Sancher, but the offer of rum by Francis is the main positive gesture between the two, and I also connect it with his mentor Zephyr (A master storyteller, who between you and me, was too fond of the bottle pg. 125), who trained Cyrille to be who he is today.Crossing the Mangrove: Wake Re-Enactment - Dinah
E400 - World Literature
Dinah:
Id like to begin by reading an excerpt of lyrics from a song. 
[...] Oh, forget about love, forget about love,
On this earth,
When youve lost your love,
Youve got nothing but tears!
I took my heart
And gave it to a wretch
To a young man without feeling,
To a young man without love (76). 
My mother sang this to me when I was a child. Her voice was sweet and almost made those harsh words seem impossible. Shed comb her dark beautiful hair while she sang. That was before I had lived.
When I was young I was sent away to work as Loulous servant. In the beginning, I could hardly understand. I was enamored with his dreamy brown eyes (78). I worked diligently, but it was never enough. I stayed immured in the home and began to feel trapped. Each day dragged on in this awful prison[1]. I felt as though I had already diedmy youth stolen and snatched away by the cruel grip of labor.
But now, to address why were gathered here today. It pains me to uncover this secret Ive held so close to my chest for so long now, but maybe it will unburden my heavy heart to share it: I am to blame for the tragedy that has just drawn to a close. [...] I am, and nobody else (79). I am responsible for the tragedy of Francis Sancher.
I had grown so weary of my confined life; jumping at every whim of those around me to satisfy, satiate, and provide solace. But then, word reached me about this man, Francis Sancher, and I had to go see for myself who was the source of such gossip and commotion. When I saw him, tall, strong, well-defined, and with a mop of jet-black hair, I couldnt help but feel overwhelmed with an unknown sense of excited nervousness. I thought to myself, Oh Lord! Imagine a hunk of a man like that in your bed night after night (80)! I ran away as quickly as Id come before I made a fool of myself[2].
That night, Francis came to my room and joined me. It started right then and there. This welcome distraction from the heavy weight of Loulous oppression provided respite from the storm of my life. I felt comfortable opening up to Francis. I was floating on airfor that brief moment at least. He even asked me to run away[3] from this life. Looking back now Im appalled by my foolishness and lack of clarity. Just as when I was a child, I chose to ignore the song that my mom sang to me as she combed her dark hairhair so jet-black and similar to Francis's. Oh, how I shouldve listened to her song. Thats when everything changed.
*Dinah gets emotional thinking about how everything is about to change (in the re-telling of her own narrative).*
	Mira ran away and I stayed there night after night waiting for Francis. He never came home. But then, when I heard the truth, that Mira had gone to live with Francis, I was devastated. Francis was that man who was an oasis in my desert, but now Mira had ripped him away from me just as Loulou ripped away my childhood (82). 
	A while later, Mira returned to me, wracked with shame and sadness. Now pregnant, she regaled me with the horror story that her life had become. Ill spare you the details of this injustice just for the sake of Miras dignity, but this is when I realized it. Just as Francis himself had said, [men are] born torturers (81). Just as my mother had warned me all those years ago, When youve lost your love,/You've got nothing but tears (76)! I gave my heart to the wretch in my mothers songFrancis was my young man without feeling and love!
	So now, as I speak at the wake of this mans passing, Im overcome with melancholy. Francis was an ephemeral light in my life that came crashing into darknessjust as my mother warned as she combed her jet-black hair, curiously flecked with auburn (77).
*Display the comb as a memento of the advice that Dinah received from her mother (but didnt adhere to) and an acknowledgment of its validity.*
THE END
------------------------------------------------------------
[1] So I stayed at home with my servant, my children, and gradually this house made of wood at the edge of the dense forest, deprived of light and sun, a paradise dripping with lovers chains and anthuriums, this house became my prison, my tomb (78).
[2] This description is inspired directly and indirectly by the description of Dinahs encounter with Sancher on page 80. At that very moment he turned towards me and his eyes plunged into mine as if he were reading my thoughts (80).
[3] Why do you put up with it? Why dont you leave (81)?Its the second time I've seen a dead body, but it's the first time I've been to a wake.[1] The first time was my grandmother when my parents took me to her funeral. It wasnt a wake, but when we drove to grandmothers house, her coffin was open with all these flowers around. I hate dead bodies. The way they are all sickly and shriveled up.[2] When I saw my grandmothers corpse, that was already a lot, but when my parents kissed her goodbye, I couldnt stand anymore and hid in the kitchen under the sink.[3] My father was disappointed in me of course.[4] Fathers don't want cowards as children. But at least I had Minerve, who told me stories as a child. She even helped Mira give birth. Poor little Mira.[5] I was there when it all happened, when Quentin was born, although I was forced to the garden so as not to get in the way by Aristide. I guess Quentin will never know his father. I wonder if he will despise him like I despise mine.
I didnt know him that well, Francis that is. In fact, I only saw him once by chance when I had to redo my algebra homework and missed my bus. As I was cutting past Grande-Savane on my walk home, passing the bay with the windsurfers, I ran into him as he sat on a tree doing absolutely nothing. As I walked past him and greeted him, he got up and followed me asking all these questions like Whats your name? How old are you? Are you getting along all right at school?[6] When I mentioned my fathers comment that I would end up like a Haitian with the marks I have, he laughed and said it wouldnt be so bad because the Haitians are a great people.[7] He even wore a necklace from Haiti, and took it off to show me. He told me how he traveled, and it piqued my interest. But one thing led to another and all of a sudden he was lecturing me about his life and something called Operation Carlotta. Anyway, when I tried to get away he chased after me and grabbed me and I got scared. He kept on talking about Carlotta, so the first chance I got I broke free and ran as fast as I could, and he ran after me again shouting. At one point I missed my footing [from running so fast] and rolled on the moss,[8] when I all of a sudden saw the spirit Xantippe right there, watching me.[9] I ran straight home without looking back. It wasnt until I got there that I realized I was still holding the necklace he showed me. When I finally sat down, I cried. My father is right: I am a coward. Why else would I cry when an old man tells me nonsense? I still have the necklace, and keep it because it reminds me of Francis telling me I dont have to listen to my father, and that being a Haitian wouldnt be so bad.[10] For some reason though, I get a bad feeling looking back, especially with the Xantippe. In my opinion, thats what killed him. He was found in the forest afterall, and it would only be fitting for a man as hated as him to have his blood drained from the Xantippe. As for me, I couldnt really care about what happened. I didnt know him, and he reminded me of my father. Im only here because Papa wants me to be a man.[11]

Immediatly, he caught my interest, because I too want to see the world when I grow up (Cond 73).

H410 - Constitutional Law
Disclaimer: The opinion I argue in this writing prompt doesnt reflect my own. I am attempting to stretch my skills of argumentation by approaching a point (I dont morally agree with) purely through a constitutional framework.
The majority opinion of the court ruled that the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment protect the right to marry as a fundamental liberty that applies equally to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. My repudiation of the majority opinion is not in fact concerned with the associated content of the case at hand or the right it does or doesnt provide or protect. This isnt and, as will become clear, shouldnt be my focus. As Justice Scalia stated in his dissenting opinion in Casey, We should get out of this area, where we have no right to be, and where we do neither ourselves nor the country any good by remaining (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey). While this area in Casey referred to abortion, the same concept of privacy applies to this case of marriage. However, thats beside the point. Today, Im not inserting myself into an issue best left resolved in a democratic way by the people it affects. No. Theres a more pressing issue. Today, I argue on the behalf of the Constitution. Today, I argue in an effort to preserve the process of law that our democracy deems so fundamental. The justices who have authored this majority opinion have blatantly overstepped the bounds of their jurisdiction. 
The lasting impact of the majoritys approach, where their words become legally binding once published, ventures into the territory of dangerous precedent. They openly acknowledge that The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, yet the majority finds it within their realm of power to address this discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture given new insight (Obergefell v. Hodges). If it was the intent of the authors of the Constitution to have the Supreme Court act as the body to reconcile discord with new insight, they would have said as much in the language they used. But, as stated in Justice Blacks dissenting opinion in Griswold, [...] there is no provision of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies (Griswold v. Connecticut). Instead, the founders of this country devised a government of and for the people. They crafted a system of constitutional amendment to address and incorporate this inevitable new insighta system of voting that upholds the integrity of our democracy and ensures that each perspective is counted. Just as the system of amendment offers a voice to the people of this country, so does the power of the state to decide the extent of their marital protections. As shown in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, a right that isnt explicitly enumerated in the Constitution (marriage in this case) is a power reserved to the states respectively, or to the people (Constitution). As Justice Scalia dissents in Obergefell, A system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy (Obergefell v. Hodges).
I end with questions of warning: What becomes of our meticulously crafted precious separation of powers, a cornerstone of our democracy, if this committee of nine unelected lawyers is free to decide based on moral whims that stem from new insight? Can the Court just decide to neglect its role, as presented in the Federalist Papers, as a body that acts with neither force nor will but merely judgment [?] In what world can we preach to lift every voice and yet consider a mere fraction of our diverse country to act as a legislative body?
Each decision that follows this dangerous precedent and intrudes on issues better left to the people threatens our system of governments
I dissent.
You are writing to a ruler on how to rule. 
You must choose a real figure, from the past or present.
You must use Augustine, Aquinas, or Machiavelli, or some combination of the three to make your argument.

Quotes:
1.Aquinas quoting Augustine: Augustine says, It is not the case that peace is sought in order that war might be waged; rather, war is waged in order that peace might be acquired.  Therefore, be peaceful when engaging in war, in order that, by subduing those whom you are fighting against, you might lead them to the benefits of peace.
Therefore it is always important to distinguish a meaning when taking a decisive course of action.
2.The prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. (Machiavelli) Be cautious to not lose control of a situation; recognize what can be attributed to your control.
3.A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. (Machiavelli, The Prince, XVIII)
Diversity of strategy is important
4.Let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on. (Machiavelli, The Prince, XVIII)
In other words, the ends justify the means; corrupt means are justifiable with desirable ends because the world consists only of the vulgar. 
5.It is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities [...], but it is very necessary to appear to have them. (Machiavelli, The Prince, XVIII)
Machiavelli claims that appearances are the only important component to rule. However, the government is not a black box. It is a contractarian system which operates on checks and balances.
Augustine Shame had more influence with [the followers of Diogenes cynical behaviors], [...] Human nature, then, is without doubt ashamed of this lust (Augustine, City of God, Book 14)
Humans are herd animals, and will be unable to withstand social pressures. It is therefore paramount to control the common social opinion of your actions. If your actions are viewed favorably, the cascade of support will be immense, but the reverse is also true.
6.One should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with (Machaivelli, The Prince, Chapter XVII)
Ideation:
It is easier to support a facade of justice when one is actually just, because that renders ones appearance as true to ones own nature.
President Lyndon Johnson domestic policy in conflict with escalations in Vietnam
Fight against communism
must be clear with intentions and have equal morals applied everywhere
example of country claiming motivations for corrupt actions is 
Soviet Union, internal propaganda stating that they support equality and justice, and wanted to help Afghanistan, a fellow communist nation against Western imperialism; however they only wanted to expand their influence, in an ironically imperialistic manner. In addition, they committed many human rights violations. -> My Lai massacre
Franklin D Roosevelt before Japanese Internment "the principle on which this country was founded and by which it has always been governed is that Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart; Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of race or ancestry." Then after Pearl Harbor Attack in 1942, Executive Order 9066 -> forced relocation and internment
To Mr. President Lyndon B. Johnson,
Now is a time of immense strife for The United States of America and her people. We are experiencing a war on two fronts, domestic and foreign. This war is a conflict on the concept of war itself: can we, as a nation that values liberty and justice and freedom, take it within our own hands to establish such ideals in other nations around the globe?
At the same time, how can we even begin to fortify those values for our fellow humans when we are bereft of the enjoyment of these rights at home? 
The advancement of the virtuous goals of education, housing, and civil rights within our homeland conflicts with the choice to escalate violence in Vietnam. The objective of war, as Augustine of Hippo stated, is that, War is waged in order that peace might be acquired. Therefore, be peaceful when engaging in war, in order that, by subduing those whom you are fighting against, you might lead them to the benefits of peace (Augustine as qtd. in Aquinas). These aforementioned benefits of peace cannot be brought to constituents of an opponent nation when we have yet to establish such rights within our own nation. So, a universal moral foundation universal to home and away is necessary to inform the difficult decision of whether to advance or retract the campaign in Vietnam. From the varying ideas ensconced within Niccolo Machiavellis, The Prince, we can derive that the unified philosophy is the state of entropy for governments, and that a schism between appearance and action degrades the function of that government. In this case, the benevolent values of the Great Society, do not support aggressive action in Vietnam.
It is paramount, in order to resolve both conflicts foreign and national, that one's ideals and values be upheld in all circumstances. The significance of a toggleable moral is vitiated by its impermanence. As such, there should be no discrepancy between how a government presents itself and its true state. Machiavelli claims that rulers need to concern themselves only with appearances. It is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities [...], but it is very necessary to appear to have them (Machiavelli, XVIII). With respect to appearances, intentions are more important than outcomes. If this were the case, we would not be discomforted by President Roosevelts statement prior to Japanese internment, "The principle on which this country was founded and by which it has always been governed is that Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart; Americanism is not, and never was, a matter of race or ancestry." Then, after the Pearl Harbor Attack in 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced relocation and internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry. There are two possible malevalences in this example, either the moral foundations of the government were not universal, or they were universal, yet obfuscated with falsehoodsthe former is more reasonable than the latter. In both cases, a mercurial and fractured leadership erodes its own ethos. Therefore, we cannot grant both more peace at home and more war in Vietnam at the same time. 
If a leader must preset true, the leader may forgo appearances by attempting to achieve desirable ends without considering the means. Machiavelli notes that the business of governing is, vulgar, and, as vulgarities are commonplace in the world, they are acceptable. Let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar (Machiavelli, XVIII). This line of thinking is corollary to a quintessential Machiavellian ideal that, the ends justify the means. Corrupt means are justifiable with desirable ends because the world consists only of the vulgar and corrupt. Upon a cursory inspection, it may seem that foul play is requisite to success. For example, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistanin a proxy war, like Vietnamtheir goal was to defend a fellow communist nation from Western imperialism. However, despite this facade, the expansion of Soviet military influence was, ironically, rather imperialist. In order to spread communism, the communists had to directly oppose their ideology. However, in our case, we should not condescend to debase our own morals in pursuit of our own ends. From recent events, the My Lai massacre deracinates the validity of the Machiavellian dictum in its entirety. Human rights violations simply cannot be justified for any goal. When the ends are separate from the means, moral incongruences become permissible. To adhere to one moral pathway and therefore to end the war in Vietnam, we cannot use more violence.
While the presence of a common moral thread is essential to a just leader, it does not render the diversity of strategy unimportant. 
Machiavelli observes that a ruler must employ different tactics in different situations, A prince, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves (Machiavelli, XVIII). If a leader must employ each style, there exists a fine line between adaptability and suppleness. A pliable leader is like a diaphanous puppet propelled by the vicissitude of the common opinion. Such leaders are considered weak. For example, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, regarded as one of the worst Spanish monarchs, flipped between implementing military and civilian dictators. Fickle leaders rely too much on luck. About fortune, Machiavelli states that, The prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes (Machiavelli, XXV). This dictates that we must maintain control over a situation. We cannot rely on the fate of the world to unfold events. Instead, we need to act. For example, when he was faced with numerous difficult choices, President Kennedy ultimately decided to impose a naval blockade on Cuba during the Missile Crisis. 
Even though Vietnam is not as time sensitive as Cuba, given the fact that the war has already been dragged out for over a decade, we must swiftly guide our actions by a universal moral foundation of respect for human rights and inherent liberties.
In conclusion, the complex decision to escalate the war in Vietnam involves not only strategic considerations but also moral values and principles. While diversity in strategy is important, it cannot be used as an excuse for moral incongruences. To uphold a universal moral foundation that aligns with the values of the "Great Society" requires a deescalation of violence in Vietnam. By adhering to a just and consistent moral framework, you, Mr. President, can lead the nation towards a peaceful and prosperous future, both domestically and internationally.

My ideal philosophy is science, whose axioms are observation and reproducibility. Science is a philosophy, a path for making meaning and finding truth, just like any other kind. The strength of science is in its ability to change. When truth is prescribed through faith and belief, it becomes static. Circling back to Socrates, why should people be educated on how to ask questions if you only want them to conform to your system? Questions allow for the system to change and grow in the future when no one yet has the right questions. It is hard for philosophers, let alone anyone, to picture a life substantially different from the one that they are living in. The genre of science fiction represents some of our best attempts to imagine alternate realitiesmost often in the future. Given that our imagination is bound by our human limitations, our political philosophies cannot escape those same axioms of life as well. Existentially, we cannot
Colonialism was an important epoch of time in our modern history that has literally shaped nations today. Colonialism is a result of the tribalism innate to human nature, in conjunction with the human capacity for rapacity and violence. Understanding how humans organize themselves and cooperate with others, both in positive ways, and negative violent colonial ones, helps to understand human nature, which ultimately informs political systems.
According to Frantz Fanon, in order to enact colonial violence, the colonized must first be dehumanized by the colonists to enable their use of extreme violence. Thus, the only way for the victims to regain their humanity is through the same commensurate fires of violence. Violence is justified when it is reflected back at the perpetrator for the greater good. Equal violence is just. Yet, there is a fundamental issue with equal violence. First, is the issue of perpetuation. Fanon makes the distinction between random violence, which causes disorder, chaos, and fear; and organized violence, which brings about change. The disciplined use of violence is a tool, not an end. However, the idea of organized violence unveils the question of how much violence is equal? Joseph Conrads, Heart of Darkness, a novel famous for its exposition of the complex evil of colonialism, describes colonial violence with, the horror, the horror, which were the last two dying words uttered by the antagonist. Violence is an absolute, horrible, all or nothing, horrible. With excess violence, there may come about a role reversal where the oppressed become the oppressors and thus a cycle emerges: the bottom become the top and the top become the bottom. However, this would only be the case if the two groups were equal. For a simple example of their differences, the colonized outnumber the colonists. This size comparison is often set up as in an upward-pointing triangle; the geometry establishes a hierarchy between the larger lower base of the colonized, and the smaller taller peak of the colonists. Fanon describes the dynamic from a strategic lens, The relationship between colonist and colonized is one of physical mass. Against the greater number the colonist pits his force. Fanon warns that the system is not stable. The colonists and colonized are in a state of constant  muscular tension, which periodically erupts into bloody fighting between tribes, clans, and individuals. This combative tendency results from the tribal inclination to label all outside groups as oppressors. A potent historical example of this effect took place in Rwanda, where the colonizers skewed occupational titles into racial classifications. The triangle is not stable when balanced on its point: the result became that the larger of the two groups, the Hutu, who were both corrupted by the dividing idea of race, committed genocide against the smaller group, the Tutsi. This tragedy occurred after the Belgians ostensible decolonization. However, the physical departure of the colonists does not ensure that their horrible ideas leave as well. The utterly internecine violence became possible only after the permeation of the colonial systems into the minds of the colonized.
Decolonization is both literal and figurative. The belief in colonial myth indoctrinates a self-inferiority complex within the colonized. They were meant to be subjugated, oppressed, ruled. It is for this reason that Fanon asserts that, violence is man recreating himself. Revolt will strip the subjects of their erroneous beliefs that have been branded upon them by the masters. However, while much thought is put into what actions the colonized should take to liberate themselves, it is only the original perpetrators, the colonists themselves, who can finally eradicate the system. Not only must the colonists leave, but they also must purge the colonist identity from within themselves in order to effectively dismantle the process. One example is the historical irony from the end of the Second World War, where the allied powers forced the fascist powers to withdraw control of their colonies, while the victors kept their colonies. Why werent their values being upheld in their own territories? The frustration with the solely external application of liberty can be seen in the civil rights and liberties movements within the United States during the time of the Vietnam War. The colonists not only inflict damage upon their colonies, but also infect their own territory with the same noxious poison. Therefore, colonialism isnt merely the subjugation of other nations, it is also generalized, in Fanons eyes, as the unwarranted control of any one group by another. This pattern is quintessential to human nature and is further understood through G.W.F. Hegels process, known as the dialectic.
Hegel describes a scenario he called the lord-bondsman dialectic. Its name has also been translated from German into the master-slave dialectic. Based on the jargon of later thinkers on the matter, like Jacques Lacan, the dialectic will henceforth be referred to as the master-subject dialectic (MSD). Hegels original dialectic is a framework for understanding humans development of knowledge of their environment. The dialectic process, called sublation, according to Hegel, will yield the ultimate goal of reconciliation of thought and reality, in other words, a complete comprehension of ones environment; this is coined Absolute Idea. However, since the environment consists of other consciousnesses, Absolute Idea is a purely Platonic and abstract idealism. Yet, the critical component still remains: how humans acquire knowledge from their fellow humans; reality is best understood when it is processed through many minds. The MSD concerns two undefined entities and how their interactions cause the beings each to define themselves from the other. These entities are at first in a state of nature, where each consciousness claims itself to be the objective measure of reality. Then, upon encountering the other, they engage in conflict as they reconcile their respective realities. The consciousness becomes self-consciousness,[1] aware that they are not one-of-a-kind and alone. The idea of inevitable conflict aligns with Thomas Hobbes naturally belligerent humankind. In the Hegelian model, the battle is a fight to the death where the winner spares the losers life because the winner needs another to recognize their victory. The loser then becomes indebted to the winner for this act of mercy, and becomes a subject to the now master. In a higher level of abstraction, the struggle is any series of actions that results in a power differential between the two entities, thereby assigning the roles of master and subject. The impetus for the MSD is less important than the subsequent dynamic between master and subject. 
Then, the master believes that they arebetter than the subject that is. However, the only data point factored into their assertion is the otherthey could merely be at the peak of mount stupid on the Dunning-Kruger curve. The master has defined themselves in relation to the subject as a master, and therefore retains the hubris that they are ethos, are god; they alone define reality. At this point, Lacan labels the master as the subject presumed to knowpresumed by the minds of both the master themself and the lesser subject. The masters strife becomes the need to be recognized, not by a lesser subject, but by an equal. Without this, the master is dependent on the recognition of the subject. Lacans view on desire helps to illustrate the masters conundrum. Lacan claims that, all desire is the desire to be desired. Both subject and master align with this rule. The subject needs to be validated by the master, yet the master needs to be recognized by an equal. The latter condition is only possible if the master ceases to be the master of all. For if two masters are equals, comparatively, they cease to be masters to each other.
While the master struggles, the subject thrives. The subject has a clear purpose, to become like the master. Through service to the master, the subject develops knowledge skills, adapting their understanding of reality. Hegel states that, the humankind has not liberated itself from servitude, but by means of servitude. This suggests that work in servitude, when it requires creativity and self expression, are inherently freeing because they allow humans to develop their consciousness to be more aware of the environment.[2] This thinking is echoed from Aristotle, who surmised that the pursuit of knowledge is pleasurable for humans. Thus, it is the subject, who works to better themselves and broaden their consciousness, for the sake of the master, who gains liberty and pleasure. Self-consciousness is freedom. 
Eventually, the subject must reevaluate the nature of their relationship with the master. The master has sat docile while the subject has toiled. One has become strong while the other has become weak. The subject is now able to call into question The basic function of a master, Slavoj iek says, is not to serve as a model to rational reasoning, providing the ultimate arguments for adopting a certain position, but on the contrary, to surprise us by uttering statements which run against our hitherto doxa. iek cautions against blind faith in the master, and instead suggests that the master is present to provide a diversity of thought aimed at improving the subject instead of propagating confirmation bias. The subject must then enter into the final stage of the MSDwhich is not present in Hegels story, but was a subsequent addition by Lacanwhere the subject uses the masters ideas to expose their limitations. Ultimately, the subject defeats the master.
The MSD is crucial for understanding colonialism. The initial stage is prompted by the colonialists' greed for resources of another land, e.g. people or materials. The colonists define themselves as better than the colonizedafter all, they are the ones who won the fight and coerced a population into subjugation. The colonialists sought to colonize in the first place in order to be recognized by equal powers, other colonialists, other European nations. The colonized become infected with the colonizers' corrupted ideas. They presume that the colonists know. The colonized people then live in a twisted reward system, to be sycophants to their tyrannical masters. This appears to be the only way to act as a subject, to obey their master. The colonized servitude builds strength, and therefore builds the tool for eventual freedom. Yet all the while continuing to feed the colonial regime. The last stage of the MSD embodies Fanons idea to use the masters own violence against them. Violence is enabled by the strength honed from the subjects servitude. Thus, the colonists' own malice renders their downfall.
This fundamental error suggests that the best way to colonize a population would, instead of subjugating them to become subjects, be to weaken them with decadence, by falsely installing them as nominal puppet masters.
The MSD produces two inquiries which challenge its fundamental standing. First, are Hegel Hobbes right? Will humans find themselves in conflict without society? The second is a query to the first, does Hegels logic hold when two entities are not in a state of nature, but rather in a societyafter all, society is required to have the colonizers and colonized. The framework of existentialism can provide answers to both of these questions. To address both questions simultaneously, the existentialist notes that society is the natural state of humans, that we are social animals, defined both as individuals but also from others. In fact, humans are so tuned toward interacting with other humans that we have special senses that identify faceseven where there arent any, pareidoliaand detect gazeseven when there arent any, scopaesthesia. Therefore, Hegels dialectic and the MSD apply to both societies and the state of nature because they are inseparable. In short, given that humans themselves into societies, is it not within their nature to be inclined to do so? Hegelian idealism pairs well with existential idealism in many facets, including the inability to answer difficult pragmatic questions.
Directly stating the most extreme, Fanon writes that, For the native[--colonized], life can only spring up again out of the rotting corpse of the settler[--colonialist]. Again, the subject defeats the master. But can the subject avoid becoming master to another? Can the subject not presume to now know just because they have defeated the one previously assumed to know? This idea of birth from death heralds the question of how to create a new humanity ignorant to violence, without a foundation of prejudice. Can a new humanity be created ex nihilo? Does that mean that everyone has to die? Could humans even exist without violence? If it is something innate to our nature, then wouldnt the same cycle perpetuate? The metaphoric lens provided by the Hegelian MSD pries apart and exposes the colonial infrastructure as the craftsmanship of a fallacious and control-seeking master. To scrutinize it will allow for its dismantlement.

Money is a commodity that, in its capacity as a measure of value, serves as a universal equivalent for all other commodities, which means that it is the direct incarnation of all human labor (Marx, Capital)
Marx has many different distinctions between different types of labor
productive labor, ex: factor job
not productive labor, ex: social labor, volunteering; domestic labor
division of labor
Smiths ideology is almost technocratic, in that machinery is celebrated as being a positive force toward achieving the goal of more labor. Those with the capacity to automate, that is those with technical skills, thereby can do better work, and in turn amass more social capital and power.
Everybody must be sensible about how much labor is abridged and facilitated by the application of proper machinery. [...] the division of labor which probably gave occasion to the invention of the greater part of those machines, by which labor is so much facilitated and abridged (Smith, Wealth of Nations).
specialization leads to invention
When the whole force of the mind is directed to one particular object, as in consequence of the division of labor it must be, the mind is more likely to discover the easiest methods of attaining that object than when its attention is dissipated among a great variety of things (Smith, Wealth of Nations).
stated two different ways
The division of labor, by reducing every man's business to some one simple operation, and by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much the dexterity of the workman (Smith, Wealth of Nations).
Development of an adroit skill might cause the people to be androids rather than humans because a monomania inhibits creativity where creativity can be defined in simple terms as the clever combination of diverse ideas. When one is put upon the obsession of a single task or skill, their diversity of ideas necessarily decreases and thereby so too does their creativity. 
Every man has a property in his own person: this nobody has any right to but himself. The labor of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labor with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property (Locke, Second Treatise).
Locke says that labor is a requisite for establishing property,
In the example of harvesting food from nature, Locke asserts, that labor put a distinction between them and common: that added something to them more than nature, the common mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right (Locke, Second Treatise). Therefore, when one takes an action that nature would not have done, one exerts their own will and influence upon the world. Derived from this idea is the definition of labor. 
Locke uses the phrase, bestown labor to indicate influence. Taking influence from physics and paying attention to synonyms of English, we can equate the act of labor as merely: work.
dialectical materialism
ancient Greek thought summoned the quandary of whether the mind forms reality, or vice versa, the former being idealism, versus the latter being materialism. cogito ergo sum vs. sum ergo cogito
Hegels dialectic: conflict arises naturally; the resolution contradictions induces the motion of matter

would systems of government naturally evolve from an organized economy?

On Economics & Politics
The foundational catalyst for Marxist political thought is dialectical materialism. In order to unpack this term, we must first understand materialism. Ancient Greek thought dealt with the quandary of whether the mind forms reality, or vice versa. The idealists adhere to the former belief, while the materialists believe the latter, that reality informs the mind. The quintessential example of idealism is Decartes statement cogito ergo sum, I think, therefore I am. The materialist claims the opposite, sum ergo cogito, I am, therefore I think. Materialism, as the name indicates, claims that the material world is the principal determinant of reality and the minds conception thereof. The pragmatic notions of materialists such as Karl Marx are reminiscent of the Aristotelian idea of deriving truth from observation; The accurate nomenclature of these two camps of thought extends to Platos opposing concept of ideal forms, which only become possible when thought controls reality.
The second component of the core Marxist precept is the dialectic. This concept is prominent in much philosophical thought, and so too is it present in Marxs ideas about economics and politics. The idea of the dialectic comes from Georg Hegel, an idealist. Condensed, the idea of the dialectic is that conflict arises naturally, and the resolution of contractions induces motion in matter or ideas. The first idea or matter, called the thesis, comes in conflict with another item, the antithesis; their resolution produces a new item, known as the synthesis. The cycle repeats as the synthesis becomes the next thesis.
The merger of these two concepts produces the dynamic that ideas change when material conditions, determined by the state of an economy, undergo conflict and become different material conditions. For our purposes, we can claim to understand this as dialectical materialism. Accordingly, economics and politics are linked because the material conditions impact the peoples functioning and therefore their political responses.
All economic systems must be controlled, or governed, by some ruleset. In nations, it is the government that encompasses this economic environment. Therefore, it would appear that the governments must be present in economies. Looking at the Lockean state of nature, we can support the assertion with several definitions. First, society is a mutual contract organized between people. Second, an economy is based on trade, which needs mutual agreement in order to make exchanges. Therefore, an economy requires a society. The maintenance and logistical codification of societys contracts, forms government. Documenting ideas solidifies the economic system across generations of minds. A charter-less organization is nothing above the minds of its members.
Without the desire to establish a rigorous proof, yet nonetheless motivated by the mathematical technique of proof by contrapositive, we can ask whether a system can exist with a limited interaction between the economy and the government. Would such systems of government happen to naturally evolve from an organized economy? For example, right libertarianism, which creates an economy free from much order, where private individuals act within their means, will give rise to a government where those with the most power exercise their will upon others; totalitarian government is still a government.
Labor
Labor is the action necessary to acquire propertyJohn Lockes main interest. Locke affirms the necessity of labor in forming property, every man has a property in his own person: this nobody has any right to but himself. The labor of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, [...] he hath mixed his labor with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property (Locke, Second Treatise). When one changes nature, work is done. Locke might point out that change to a specific patch of nature produces the property of land. However, since the ownership of land must be agreed upon by multiple individuals in society, labor needs society to be recognized, and the economy of land needs labor to exist. As a result, labor connects society and economy.  
One alteration of nature, for example, is harvesting food. Locke notes that labor redefines natural items into ownable and thus tradable commodities, labor put a distinction between [the harvested] and common: that added something to them more than nature, the common mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right (Locke, Second Treatise). Therefore, when one takes an action to alter the course of nature, one exerts their own will on the world. Derived from this influence is a definition of labor. Labor is action that creates goods. The economy is a system of good trading and is therefore possible only because of labor.
Since labor creates both property, a societal construct; and goods, an economic construct; it demonstrates that both society and economy are heavily related through the frequent human action of imposing ones will upon the world.
Money
According to Marxism, money is a tool without inherent value. It has value only because of its ability to be exchanged. A good item for money is one that is universal, so that it is useful anywhere; secure, so that it cannot be forged; and divisible, so that it can adhere to as specific of a value as is needed. Money ought to be like a particle that communicates the force of exchange valueonly morons hoard bosons! Exchange value is an abstract quantification of the amount and quality of labor that goes into a good or service. Defined by Marx, Money is a commodity that, in its capacity as a measure of value, serves as a universal equivalent for all other commodities, which means that it is the direct incarnation of all human labor (Marx, Capital). We will see later how money arose from the need for universally applicable equivalence. Exchange value potentially ignores aesthetic appreciationfor example, Pollock, or minimalist artists. According to the model, labor went into the artists education, so time in school might constitute a large labor time, even if a piece was crafting in a comparatively minute amount of time. In addition, the innate valuation of land from its natural resources varies in the absence of applied labor. In essence, we should not ascribe existential value to money by divorcing it from the fundamental means of production; it is, instead, the labor that we should value.
One interesting hypothetical discourse is the legitimacy of the amassment of money, and how collecting money must correspond with the investment of concordant labor toward society. For example, the stock market is a business that ascribes existential value to money. People do work, not for the sake of improving the material condition of society, but rather to play a complex game aimed to extract as much value from the system as possible. Artificial monetary value is scrounged ex nihilo, and thus the importance of labor is undermined.
	To better observe the obsessive compulsion of efficiency and productivity in capitalismwhich are construed into a harsh light by Nietzschean thinking through inquiring why productivity is sought if it only brings rampant stresswe make the distinction between two types of labor: productive and not productive. The former generates goods and services directly, while the latter does not whatsoever, or does not directly. In productive labor, such as a factory job, the worker can see their produced goods. In the other kind, for example, social labor such as volunteering or domestic labor, workers do not provide a tangible output from their service. However, their contributions are not negligible, for without those labors, the direct productive sort would cease to be so.
Automation
In Smiths ideology, machinery is celebrated as being a positive force toward more labor and therefore more productivity; this thinking may yield technocratic outcomes. Those with the capacity to automate, that is those with technical skills, can produce in greater quality and quantity, and, in turn, amass more rewards. Smith thanks the diversity of labor for augmenting skill and therefore productivity, everybody must be sensible about how much labor is abridged and facilitated by the application of proper machinery. [...] the division of labor which probably gave occasion to the invention of the greater part of those machines, by which labor is so much facilitated and abridged (Smith, Wealth of Nations). So, specialization not only leads to increased productivity on its own, but it also leads to invention, which likewise increases productivity.
	In particular, to fixate ones mind on a single topic will allow the full might of the human brain to ponder the matter, and therefore make insights that would otherwise have been more difficult to derive had the individual split their attention across many tasks. Smith states this idea, when the whole force of the mind is directed to one particular object, as in consequence of the division of labor it must be, the mind is more likely to discover the easiest methods of attaining that object than when its attention is dissipated among a great variety of things (Smith, Wealth of Nations). Even though the microcosmic successes are proportional to focus, we should not lose track of the bigger picture and potential consequences.
There are downsides to optimizing a society for economic productivity. The development of a single adroitness might cause the people to become androids rather than humans. A monomania inhibits creativitythat is the clever combination of diverse ideas. When ones mind is placed solely on a single task, the diversity of ones ideas necessarily decreases, and thereby so too does ones creativity. Creativity is also a requirement for invention. Therefore, overfixation is also problematic.
Another issue is alienation, when workers are no longer in charge of the outcomes of their labor. When society becomes single-minded in productivity, increased quantity may tend to reduce product quality, in addition to the quality of life of the producers themselves. In artisan craftsmanship, one group is in charge of the production and valuation of their products from inception to sale. The modernization of labor through the industrial revolution tends to production line specialization: one worker works one menial job, all for the purpose of efficiency. The result of this framework is less pride and motivation of the workforce as they do not witness nor control their output.
	An additional symptom of the industrial revolution is the aversion to laziness. Aristotle figured that the pursuit of knowledge is innate to human nature. People are not mentally lazy when it comes to their desires. However, with labor, especially tedious manual labor for the single goal of producing the most volume, can be taxing. As such, the preoccupation with laziness, the lack of productivity, is an idea spawned by the production-obsessed capitalist economy. Working can give people purpose in their lives, which, according to Victor Frankl, ought to result in happiness. However, that purpose needs to be self-selected, which is the same condition as in Aristotles thinking. Being forced into the position of a labor drone does not result in happiness. To sustain oneself and engage in politics, one must labor; only economic pawns can move on the board of politics.
Smiths mechanization is the balance between the optimization of output and the happiness gained by the pursuit of ones own goals. In an environment where work is necessary for survival, such as in a capitalist economy, some may take satisfaction from playing the system by working to make their work easier; by filling ones life with the goal to work smarter, one can better achieve the miserable purpose to please the system. Of course, the fruits of the automation-enhanced labor might then spread merely to the few private owners of the machines. While it might scare those that are comfortably situated in their role as robotic workers within a factory government, there is a benefit to automation. Machines, especially the artificial intelligences of the future, will remove outdated jobs and components of labor from the production ecosystem. This will hopefully render happiness, or we will see a growing Amish population.
In the end, we will all worship computer gods, who are infinitely more capable than we, as that is the only pathway to expanding the human race past the inevitable death of organic life on our planet. We must not become the robots, yet we must succumb to them!Instructions:

Majority Decision:
The states of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee have refused to license same-sex marriages and recognize same-sex marriages licensed in other states. The appellant claims that the state legislation is unconstitutional on the grounds of the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment.
The question at hand becomes whether states have the power to restrict marriage between persons of the same sex or refuse to recognize same-sex marriages enacted in other states.
The importance and accuracy and this decision is procured from the corresponding importance of marriage in our society. Marriage is used to establish stable families and facilitates the individuals fundamental freedom to pursue happiness. Marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man, fundamental to our very existence and survival (Loving 196). Marriage has historically been recognized as a right, yet it has been guaranteed implicitly through the right to privacy as understanded from the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The historical desire to manage the process of marriage according to outdated morals surrounding race has already been addressed in Loving v. Virginia; Stare decisis indicates that marriage should not be restricted by the states, but is, instead, a constitutionally protected right of the individual.
HISTORY 
The statues at hand preventing same-sex marriage were constructed based on moral rationales. When states construct legislation based on a proprietary moral foundation, the intent of such laws must be considered rational as well. Morality and rationality are derived from the common understanding of the people of a state. There are certain classesof which, the suspect classes are a subsetthat cannot be rationally discriminated between. From Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld racist segregation in 1896, 58 years elapsed before legislation realized that racism is irrational through Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, about a century before Loving v. Virginia was decided in 1967. So, it takes a very long time to establish, not just legislatively, but also in the common understanding of the people, what is irrational. The same is true of sexual identity. Finally, after 154 years, the Court today seeks to prove that sexual identity is an indiscriminable class based on the right privacy. 
FOURTEENTH
The Loving Court brought forth the states flawed argument for how inter-racial marriage restriction is in agreement with the Fourteenth Amendment. the State argues that the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, as illuminated by the statements of the Framers, is only that state penal laws containing an interracial element as part of the definition of the offense must apply equally [] Members of each race are punished to the same degree (Loving 195). By this reasoning, only the persons choosing to participate in a same-sex marriagewhich are typically persons identifying, at least in part, as homosexualwould be punished. Thus, such an interpretation would irrationally discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and thereby violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead, to ensure that individuals of all fifty states are guaranteed their constitutional rights, there must exist no difference between same-sex and opposite-sex couples with regards to marriage.
Unlike race and sex, the government has reason to create distinctions between married and unmarried persons, one such example is taxation. Thus, the prohibition of certain persons from transitioning between discrete classes must fall under a rigid scrutiny if different rights will be afforded to the status-changed individual.
PRIVACY
The right to marriage is not explicitly mentioned in the constitution. Therefore, it must be derived from the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
In demonstrating the scope of the substantive force of the
liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, Lawrence draws from Casey to assert that, our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education (Lawrence 181). These five aforementioned rights are previously established liberties from Roe, Casey and Griswold, and Meyer and Pierce. These rights, guaranteed by the right to privacy are provided to an individual when united in a marriage. Therefore marriage can also be protected under the right to privacy.
The Lawrence court adds, These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State (Lawrence 181). In Summary, marriage is essential to life and the pursuit of meaning and happiness. This right needs to be granted to all individuals regardless of their sexual orientation. Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do (Lawrence 181). This autonomy of choosing any consenting human partner for a spouse protected by the right to privacy.
CONCLUSION
Marriage is a fundamental right enjoyed by individuals in the United States regardless of how the union matches persons by their race or sex. These two classes are indiscriminable when it comes to marriage because marriage is protected by the right to privacy.Scrap Thinking
Historical practices adopted into American culture have not all stood through the undulation of the zeitgeists. As shown the eugenics-based rulings of Buck v. Bell, the common understanding of the people can change quite rapidly. Then, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson began to address the absurdity of eugenics and pseudoscience. Because of the possibility of sudden changes in the moral consciousness of the people, it is important to separate such long-standing and positive traditions as marriage from the purview of state legislatures. Thus, states must recognize the rights of individuals to participate, unhindered by states, in such traditions as marriage.
The use of history can help courts keep legislative stability and direct policy on gradual paths toward supporting a more perfect union. At the same time, history can also impede positive social change. History needs to be comprehended through a lens of rational checks and balances. However, the problem with this is that rationality comes from morality, which comes from tradition, which comes from history. This cycle of ideas is a feedback loop. To break from this loop, courts sometimes need to make decisions that go against history. For example, expanding the constitutional protections of marriage in Loving and Obergefell. Decisions can benefit from demonstrating that their lines of reasoning are congruent with historical conventions. However, history harms decisions when there are no other lines of reasoning to justify the history, other than the history itself.

Prompts
-What do these cases mean for the origins of the right to liberty? 
-How do these cases build off of each other? 
-What are the downsides of the way these cases were decided?
The initial cases helped the supreme court establish a system of interpretation methods for dealing with subsequent ones. Each case introduces an interpretation method, contains a decision informed by the generated rule for its particular instance, and sets up new liberties. These cases are: Marbury v. Madison, which brought the supremacy clause and judicial review; Lochner v. New York, which introduced the rational basis test and an understanding of police power, the management of an individual's rights by a state in the context of their populusaa a whole, as limited by substantive due process; and Meyer v. Nebraska, that expanded upon police power and unveiled the function of common law in the constitution. In a recursive manner, the instance decision formed a new interpretation tool that aided in resolving the decisions of the following cases; the rules acted as prerequisites for establishing more rules. Due to this pattern, without the preceding tools, the latter ones could not have been established.
In order to understand each of the tools, it is necessary to see how they apply to both the instance case and the subsequent cases. Both judicial review and the supremacy clause were established by Marbury v Madison. The instance decision of this case revolved around whether Marbury was owed an unimportant job, but the two concepts that came out of this case arn contrastingly very important. The first item is the supremacy clause, which states that the constitution is the main database of axioms from which all other law tables must be derived. The second is the principle of judicial review. This idea initializes the supreme court by self-assigning the power to declare law unconstitutional to the courts responsibilities. Without the ability to challenge the constitutionality of laws, the Court would  be bereft of purpose and not be what it is today.
Lochner v. New York, another foundational case, introduced the rational basis test (R.B.T.), a means for determining the acceptable domain of police power. In this case, an employer wanted his bakers to work for over sixty hours in a week. In order for the state government to enforce police power and interfere with the liberty of the worker and the employer to make a contractthis is the liberty formed by Lochner, the state's law must first pass the R.B.T. The R.B.T. puts the burden of proof on the state to show that they have circumstance to restrict liberties.--This changed, however, with strict scrutiny, a similar paradigm to the R.B.T. that required the affected party to prove the state should not restrict their freedoms. The R.B.T. says that the states have the right to restrict liberties if it seems reasonable to do so. Reasonable manners of regulation fall under three areas: dangerousness of an activity, necessary or emergency of an activity, and moral standards regarding an activity. The aforementioned are, such reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the governing power of the State in the exercise of those powers, and with such conditions the Fourteenth Amendment was not designed to interfere. (Lochner 34). The majority opinion states that the individual liberties granted by the fourteenth do not supersede the common good and the wellbeing of society. (Lochner 42). An example of policing based upon moral standards is sexism in workplace legislations because it was believed that women needed more protections as they were perceived as weaker than men. With regards to the danger of an activity, reason allows states to ensure the health of their citizens, such as the health of the bakers during their long work hours as seen in Lochner. Specifically, the liberty of contrast may be, subjected to regulations designed and calculated to promote the general welfare or to guard the public health, the public morals or the public safety. (Lochner 42). Safety can be thought of as a category containing health. One issue with this regulation is that the justices are not scientists, so their understanding of what is healthy is constructed from a communal perspective and not a scientific one. An example of regulation by necessity could invoke historical precedent, when a state has been using police power already, it will thus not upset the status quo. While the rational basis test is not a permanent addition to the Court's toolkit, it was necessary in defining some of the first unacceptable uses of police power. With the shift to affectee-burdened proofs of strict scrutiny, the basic rights granted by the Meyer v. Nebraska may never have been lifted out from under police power.
Police power is judged by the R.B.T. again in Meyer v. Nebraska. In this instance case, the question is whether or not a child under the eighth grade can learn the German language. It is important to note that this case takes place around the time of WWI, so there is an anti-German sentiment instilled in the populus at that moment in time. However, a sentiment that has temporal seniority and thus more importance is that of the learning in relation to the American national ethos as described in The Ordinance of 1787, stating, "religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." (Meyer 50). The majority opinion applies the R.B.T., reasoning that, experience shows that this is not injurious to the health, morals or understanding of the ordinary child. (Meyer 52). So, in conjunction with the related decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, police power cannot deprive the liberty of a parent to decide how their child is educated because the education is not harmful to society and conflicts with the common understanding that Americans value learning. As an aside, it is interesting to note where the police power is being applied, on the teaching of the material, or the learning of the material, which transgression is viewed as more severe?
The final interpretation rule was addressed by Meyer v. Nebraska, common law. Common law sits of the same foundations of communal decision making as the R.B.T. does, yet it encompasses much more than just police powers. Common law is non non-codified, meaning that it establishes rights without any formal documented definition. These unlisted rights exist everywhere, so long as they do not interfere with the rights that are listed. The informal set of common law is formally determined to be a part of the constitution by Meyer v. Nebraska, privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men [...] The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered with. (Meyer 50). Common law will apply to all cases from here, either implicitly or explicitly.
Just as cases with appropriate standing are needed to challenge laws, they are also needed to develop new interpretational methods as well. These threemerging Pierce and Meyer under the realm of educational libertiescases are essential for establishing the basic principles that inform how all subsequent cases are decided.
Discuss the idea of public health versus fundamental rights
Public health is a communal liberty. Everyone must contribute in some manner to a common good. In the case of Jacobson, everyone must waive a certain amount of their individual corporal liberty and receive a vaccination so that the community of Massachusetts can remain healthy. Jacobson establishes the fact that communal liberty supersedes individual liberty when there is no evident harm being done to the individualthe judges used a rational basis test in this case and swiftly determined that Jacobsons claims of vaccine-caused harm were not proven. This trend that public health takes precedence over fundamental individual rights will follow in both the cases Buck and Skinner, but different levels of scrutiny will be employed rather inappropriately.
	To further understand public health as a communal liberty, we need to fully explore the way it is established in Jacobson. By observing the judges' holding, it is revealed that the use of police power to mandate vaccination for the good of public health is reasonable. The Court reiterates the use case of the rational basis test, "A common belief, like common knowledge, does not require evidence to establish its existence, but may be acted upon without proof by the legislature and the courts" (Jacobson 70). The Court knows that Smallpox is deadly, and so they use the rational basis test to determine that legislation that oppresses the individual liberty of bodily freedom to not be vaccinated is appropriate. This level of scrutiny may be lenient, but such a decision aligns with our modern day understanding of what is acceptable; e.g. we have a Covid vaccination mandate.
Jacobson notes that individual liberty is not inherently unregulated because it may affect others liberties, Even liberty itself, the greatest of all rights, is not unrestricted license to act according to one's own will. It is only freedom from restraint under conditions essential to the equal enjoyment of the same right by others" (Jacobson 68). The Court goes on to present the hypothetical example that if everyone was free to take what they please, then no one would have liberty of property (Jacobson 67). So there exists a boundary on the scope of individual liberty because otherwise components of liberty would overlap, and thus the law would be paradoxical; in order to counter this, we need to decide which parts of individual liberty must be retained. So, when there is a disease that needs to be eradicated, we may violate some liberties.
In Buck, the Court made the abhorrent claim that, in their words,  imbecility, is a disease that needs to be eradicated. Based on our understanding of Jacobson, if three generations of imbeciles (Buck 77), are indeed detrimental to public health, such that they somehow violate communal liberties, and their removal by sterilization does not violate their individual liberties too much because it is, without detriment to [ones] general health (Buck 76), then the rational basis test is appropriate. However, fit with a modern understanding, we know that the Court made an erroneous decision because they used their invalid common knowledge to make the assumption that sterilization doesnt negatively affect the health of the victims. They also assumed that mental differences are entirely genetic (Buck 76). The reason, to put it concisely, was that the judges were old white men who didnt think nor care about the actual severity of sterilization of women. In Skinner, the majority opinion notes that sterilization of a man violates his liberties, He is forever deprived of a basic liberty (Skinner 81). However they missed this in Buck. The judges conclude that sterilization is harmful to the individual so much so that the rational basis test cannot be used. the Act is penal in character, and that the sterilization provided for is cruel and unusual[the same language in the Eighth Amendment]punishment and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment (Skinner 80). But, again, they did not perceive the forced sterilization of women as violating their basic liberties nor being harmful to their health. The court should have used strict scrutiny because people of mental differences living and having children is not, in fact, detrimental to public health.
To expand, the holding in Skinner determined that the Oklahoma law that sterilization of repeat offenders of certain crimes was unconstitutional due to the fact that unequal protection was not given to embezzlers as opposed to larsonists for essentially the same crime. This was the logic of the majority decision. The concurring opinion by Justice Jacson brought into question the government's means of exercising punishment by medical procedure. The justice says, There are limits to the extent to which a legislatively represented majority may conduct biological experiments at the expense of the dignity and personality and natural powers of a minority This brings up the question of whether the government has a right to conduct experiments on population. Skinner suggests that these experiments must pass strict scrutiny in order to be upheld in legislation. This comes from the concurring opinion of Chief Justice Stone, arguing that the legislation is unconstitutional because of both the lack of due process, and, most importantly, the fact that criminality is not inheritable. So, it does not affect the publics health nor their communal liberty. Therefore, Skinner correctly uses the lens of strict scrutiny to determine that legislation that inflicts the punishment of sterilization must be the only means by which the problem can be solvedsome people are imprisoned without sterilization, so it is not the only means. Yet, what the judges are still neglecting is that sterilization is not the correct means of solving the supposed problem of having people with mental differences living in society. The lesson to be learned is that biological experimentation is a very difficult course of action to support because science and health are topics about which the judges do not have expertise with above common knowledge; the judges are judges and not scientists or doctors. Additional Notes
One side note about this decision is that it is only applicable to the local scope of a single state, in this case, Massachusetts and not all the states. The safety and the health of the people of Massachusetts are, in the first instance, for that Commonwealth to guard and protect. They are matters that do not ordinarily concern the National Government (Jacobson 72). In other words, there exists a dichotomy such that the federal government wants to ensure that each state has the individual liberty to decide how best to establish its own communal liberties.
Holmes, speaking for the Court in Bain Peanut Co. v. Pinson, stated, We must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints (referenced in Skinner 80).

Knowledge
The nature of education is dynamic because the frontiers of human knowledge continue to expand. Since philosophy is one exercise of education, specifically a study of human nature, philosophy too is dynamic. As such, any statements about education are metacognitive, and therefore subject to change upon being realized. In other words, to strive toward truth in knowledgethe process which is called educationone must solidify their understanding in writing or other communicative media. Once a philosophical standpoint has been frozen in place, it can no longer be influenced by a change in the common understanding. Therefore, the second goal of the philosopher who wishes to pragmatically escape from the abstract realm of the mind by writing their ideas down must document that which they expect to hold true for the most amount of time. So, this commentary of education, like all works of philosophy, seeks to find the truth that will be applicable for the longest period of time.
The Scientific Method
It may be claimed that such truth exists independent of whether or not the truth is real to the universe; or imagined, in the sense that most humans believe it to be true, so it therefore is. A truth can be validated if it can be reproduced. The idea of identifying truth by matching consistent causes with consistent results is known as the scientific method. The scientific method is the mechanism and structure by which all knowledge of rational facts is best acquiredother categories of truths are, for example, emotional or cultural ones. Such truths may exist without a reproducible reason.

What is the role of education?
Part Zero: Query Understanding
Part Alpha: Define Terms
Education is the imparting of knowledge; this act is called teaching.
Types
Knowledge can perhaps be sorted into three fields: social, which pertains to the conduct that aids in human interaction; material, which comprises humankinds thinking on how the world works; and wisdom[1], which is an individual's interpretation of the interplay between the two former fields.
These three fields correspond to pathos, logos, and ethos respectively.
For governments, education is primarily concerned with material knowledge, as it is this type of knowledge that is most helpful for advancing the government and its interests. Material knowledge can be subdivided into that which is already known to humans, and that which is not. This latter set is infinite, and therefore we will never know more than what we do not know[2].
All three types of knowledge are useful for the function of government. Social knowledge and wisdom lead to effective collaboration within the social contract that is the government.
Part Beta: Affected Groups Aims & Limitations
All nations are composed of citizens. The goal of the individual citizen may be multifarious, but, within the plethora of objectives that may be sought within a lifetime, happiness is often a component found in these goals. Aristotle claimed in Poetics that humans derive pleasure from attempting to understand, and as such would be motivated to acquire knowledge for its own sake.
When humans seek knowledge, it may not always be to benefit a state.[3] Some individuals may seek to gain knowledge independently of nations, though nations are most certainly tangled in the means of discovery[4]. 
Regardless of the purpose of an individual quest for knowledge, they all face the same hindrances. 
Humans are limited by their influx capacity for new knowledge. They can only learn so much in a given time interval[5].
Humans are also limited by their desire; to continue to learn about a topic requires the learner to be perpetually interested in the subject matter. Intrigue is the lubricant of cognition. Given the need for fascination, the question that follows is about the origin of the area of interest. Is it found in an individuals nature, or nurture? If one were educated on a topic at a malleable period in their adolescence, would that spark curiosity, or incite annoyance?
An individual is also limited by competition in society[6]. 
Learning that which is already known to others is an absorbent task, yet required to discover that which is not yet known. All individuals cannot be learning that which is not yet known at all times. So, some must teach and some must act upon that which they already know.
Who is responsible for deciding the state of the individual? If the individual holds the choice for deciding when to acquire, when to exercise, and when to relay knowledge, they must also have the means to make such a choice. The individual is the tool of the educational institutionthe university.
The university seeks to advance the frontier of the nations[7], or humankinds knowledge[8]. The universitys job, then, is to catch up individuals on extant knowledge to provide them with the capacity to render new knowledge. This information discovery factory is limited by the states desire for knowledge for its own sake. Not all knowledge is helpful to the state. Unlike humans, nations do not derive pleasure from understanding, yet they do derive pleasure from the wellbeing of their citizens. Knowledgeable citizens
Part One: Oppositionary Opening
What if there was no state-provided education? Would the people organize their own? Would the desire for new knowledge allow for humans to surpass the hubris of having certain knowledge which others do not? Or would a nation run rampant with a melee of autodidacts struggling to put together all the pieces on their own? Is a tertiary entitysuch as a university, apart from the citizens and the nationrequired in order to facilitate knowledge?
Can a nation operate with static knowledge? Static knowledge would require that, if existent, the judiciary branch be frozen, and not  resolve cases nor add them to the records. This would create new data, new information, a new potential interpretation of history, and thus new knowledge. Perhaps a state must be frozen in order to be bereft of knowledge? Thereby new knowledge, and therefore education, is paramount, as a fuel, to the engine of the state.
Moreover, a static state requires that its constituents be equally rigid. As Plato stated in The Republic, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human characters (Plato, The Republic, Book VIII). If they are not solidified, a populus of fluctuating thought might lead to a nation of fluctuating principles. An excess of fluctuation might result in a dearth of stability. 
So, to compromise between a state of stagnant mundanity and dangerous turbulence, the sum of individual knowledge ought to have spread the gamut of opinion. The individuals should support their diverse opinions strongly, but adapt to change eloquently as well. This balance could create a strong citizen.
Part Two: Educations Purpose
Part Three: Educations Structure
------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Wisdom is best attained by imitation of those that, to the imitator, appear wise, as opposed to being taught by one whom the learner may not deem to be wise.
[2] Intellectual humility is wise, yet best paired with social humility. When Socrates stated that he was smarter than all others for he knows that all know nothingexcept he of course, who knew that one detailhe displayed talent for logos, but neglected pathosyet this was his ethos. Those, such as the Vulcans of Star Trek, would view Socrates wise, as they value logos.
[3] A hyperbolic hypothetical, for example, might be a terrorist who attempts to learn how to best terrorize their target nation by residing within said nation.
[4] Unless one has the wealth or the means to escape the confines of government, such as sending a car into space for no scientific purpose whilst states wish to regulate what is happening in space.
[5] With current technology, we cannot learn Kung Fu like Neo in The Matrix. If we could, would the storage capacity become an issue for all that we wished to fit inside our heads? Would the art of teaching be lost?all those that were educated on how best to educate others would cease to be teachers but instead become first-hand witness historians.

The first two of these cases set the foundation for the authority of the Supreme Court and the Constitution. Marbury first establishes the ability for the Court to overturn laws that go against the Constitution while Lochner goes on to create a system for judging when a law has stepped over the Constitution. 
Marbury v. Madison was the first case that established the Supreme Courts authority to overturn laws that went against the Constitution and established the Constitution as the law of the land. The court uses the Supremacy Clause to assert its authority in cases where the Constitution and the law conflict.  So, if a law be in opposition to the Constitution, if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply (Marbury, 29). The court then goes on to attest putting the law before the Constitution would subvert the very foundation of all written Constitutions. It would be giving to the Legislature a practical and real omnipotence with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits. It is prescribing limits, and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure (Marbury, 29). This precedent that Marbury sets will later be expanded by Lochner. 
Lochner v. New York built off of the authority Marbury established and created a rational basis test which put the burden of proof on the party that was claiming a law was unconstitutional. In Lochners case, the Court used health as the test for whether the law was justified and found that baking was not dangerous enough to warrant the law prohibiting bakers from working a number of hours a week. It is manifest to us that the limitation of the hours of labor as provided for in this section of the statute under which the indictment was found, and the plaintiff in error convicted, has no such direct relation to, and no such substantial effect upon, the health of the employee as to justify us in regarding the section as really a health law (Lochner, 40).  Since the law had failed this test, the Court deemed that it was an unnecessary infringement on freedoms and violated the Constitution. 
Taken together, Marbury and Lochner created the system for the Supreme Court to evaluate when a law is unconstitutional and granted the Court the authority to nullify such laws. These two cases essentially made the Supreme Court what it is today. What is the Ideal Education?
H420 - Political Philosophy: Luca Millard-Kish
Education is the process of giving or receiving systematic instruction. At its essence, its about the exchange of information. But what is that system of instruction? What information is being exchanged in this process we deem so fundamental? Who is found to be worthy of this information, and once theyve obtained it, what obligation (if any) do they have to share it with those still searching? In short, what is the structure and means of achieving the ideal form of education?
Philosophers have debated across history in an effort to answer these questions. Allan Bloom initially viewed the university as the epitome of society where people were lauded for their genuine achievements, wisdom, and intellect. However, over time, Bloom found his view of the university as an educational eutopia to be naive. The theoretical life was far more fragile than hed imagined. At university, Bloom came to think that The elite should really be elite, but these elitists were given the distinction they craved without having earned it (Bloom). He was exposed to the inherent flaws of the education system as it was. While the concept of the university was praised for its high achievement and forward-thinking, it excluded people who had the potential to be elite but were never given the opportunity while placing others on a pedestal they may not have truly earned.
Further related to the concept of opportunity, we turn to the much earlier philosophy of Plato. In book eight of Platos Republic, Plato sets up four forms of governmenteach at a successive level of degradation toward less justice (as Plato saw it). When considering the oligarchical state, he claims that there is an inevitable population of paupers in which [...] there are also many criminals to be found [...], rogues who have stings (Plato, Book 8). These are the people who may have the capacity to be elite but feel trapped in their circumstances. Plato follows up by asserting that The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education (Plato Book 8). This is key. 
To consider the ideal form of education, we must consider where we want that to take us as a society. We must first examine elements of state. As Plato says, this yearning for education is at the root of turmoil and unrest. Those who wish to rise up or rebel only wish so because they feel that there is a weight on them that inhibits the completely free pursuit of their best self. If a lack of education creates this divide, fueled by hostility and resentment from those less fortunate who may very well have the potential to be elite, then shouldnt everyone have access to education? What one does with that education is up to their discretion, but equal access to education could help to quell feelings of animosity from those forced to remain ignorant.
On the concept of ignorance, I now, after having established the societal benefit of access to education, turn toward the challenge of devising what that education system itself looks like. In considering this question, I turn again to Plato, but this time to his Allegory of the Cave. Plato begs the question, How could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads (Plato)? The ignorant arent to blame for what they could never have known. Its the responsibility of people who have had access to education to share that with others. These people become the teachers. But, does the knowing person teach the ignorant person exactly what they know and expect the ignorant person to take that as dogma? Or, does the knowing person teach the ignorant one how they learned all that they have and then leave it up to the ignorant person to seek out their unique truth? The latter option has more potential to fuel a progressive society that encourages the open questioning of ideas not for the sake of proving someone wrong, but rather to promote a deeper understanding of ones own beliefs. This is very much akin to the Socratic method.
From the reasoning above, I propose the ideal system of education to be both accessible to everyone and also crafted to instill the ability to establish personal principles and better understand certain preexisting societal values. In this model society, people are encouraged to become well-rounded not in an effort to stretch themselves too thin, but in an attempt to find what they truly love (a place where they naturally excel). In a contrasting society where people are educated for the sole purpose of staffing the best trades, they miss the crucial in-between step where people have the opportunity to discover what that trade should be (aside from what may be projected on them from society) in order to best contribute to their diverse and vibrant society. What are you trying to advance through your society and, by extension, your education system? Should people be selected based on their qualifications or in an effort to have greater representation? In this model society, representation comes before qualifications. Let everyone be represented in academic institutions and have access to the same opportunities to, as Allan Bloom would say, become elite. Then, and only then, can the question of whether someone is qualified be considered a determining factor.
Although Skinner, Buck, and Jacobson cover diverse topics, they are all connected through the strain between public health and fundamental rights. Through these cases, the Court defines where fundamental rights must be sacrificed for public health based on the duty to the State, scientific benefit to the individual and public, and equal protection of the law. 
Jacobson attests that individuals owe the sacrifice of personal liberties for public health to receive governmental protection. We are not prepared to hold that a minority enjoying the general protection afforded by an organized local government, may thus defy the will of its constituted authorities, acting in good faith for all (Jacobson, 72). Here, the Court treats society as a contractional relationship between individuals and the State. In regards to the greater good and general protection, an individual cannot have one without the other. The Court upholds mandatory vaccination because it applies to all and is believed to be a scientific societal good. 
Buck follows similar logic to apply duty to the government and societal good to those with limited mental capacity. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence (Buck, 76). Again like in Jacobson, the sacrifice of personal freedom is viewed as a condition for the States support and protection. Sterilization of feebleminded people is essential for a competent population, and is seen as a lesser sacrifice than the imprisonment they would otherwise face. The scientific public and individual benefit and public duty necessitate the sacrifice of individual freedoms.
For Skinner, the Court uses equal protection and science to draw the line where public health cannot infringe on individual rights. We have not the slightest basis for inferring that the inheritability of criminal traits follows the neat legal distinctions which the law has marked between those two offenses (Skinner, 81). There is no public benefit in sterilization if the law only applies to certain crimes. If criminality were truly inheritable, the sterilization law would not have exemptions. Thus, the law is not truly enforced for the sake of public health but for individual punishment. This is what differentiates it from the previous two cases. Jacobson and Buck applied to everyone, vaccinations for all and sterilization of all feebleminded people, but Skinner made an arbitrary division between different crimes, violating the idea of equal protection and by extension, benefit to the public.
Taken together, these three cases build a test for public health impeding fundamental rights. Based on duty to the government and public, the law must be applied to everyone equally without arbitrary exemptions and be based on the perceived scientific public good. While these parameters appear valid, the limited scientific knowledge and biases at any given time period, as seen with Buck, create the system for needlessly stripping fundamental rights from certain groups. Essay to a Ruler
H420 - Political Philosophy
Dear Isoroku Yamamoto and the Japanese Government,
The year is 1941, and I write this letter to urge you to reconsider your military actions in Pearl Harbor. It has come to my attention that there have been numerous attempts at diplomacy as you have negotiated with the United States about the withdrawal of your forces from southern Indochina. I commend you for your patient negotiation up until now, but Ive also heard word that Franklin D. Roosevelt has received news that youre no longer being sincere in these negotiations by continuing to move towards Indochina and Thailand. So now, before you carry out your plan to prevent American interference, I implore you to heed my words of warning and those of brilliant political minds before me: Since there has been no direct injury, this attack doesnt satisfy the criteria for a just war. Also, if even after reading this, you see no other option, let me advise you on how to proceed with this last resort.
Firstly, I believe that this is a political conflict that must still be resolved through diplomatic means. The bombing of Pearl Harbor is bound to inspire a vengeful response from the United States, and I believe that this military action contradicts the requirements of a Just War in two ways. 1) In his Just War Theory, Thomas Aquinas quotes Augustine claiming that Just wars are normally defined as wars that avenge injuries, where the nation or city to be punished is one that has either neglected to make amends for what was done unjustly by its subjects or refused to restore what was lost through injury (Augustine in Aquinas). In this scenario, I do not see evidence of any physical injuries that would justify a war. Additionally, the United States is doing the opposite of whats outlined here: they are trying to negotiate and therefore have not neglected to make amends. 2) Now on the topic of insidious tactics in warfare, your plan also misses the mark. Out of the two forms of deception, these proposed actions fall under the firstimpermissible one. As Aquinas explains, the first form of deception is when [someone] is told something false or because a promise is not kept. This is always impermissible, and no one should deceive his enemies in this way. (Aquinas) Mr. Yamamoto, if you carry out your plans, this would break the promises of peace that you had made with the United States and therefore be considered insidious tactics. I ask you to consider the other side of the coin for a minute and imagine your feelings and those of your nation if such insidious tactics were prepared against you.
Now, as promised, if these two reasons to reconsider your plan arent satisfactory, let me provide my advice on how to best carry out this insidious and unjust sneak attack (as I fear it will come to be seen). If you find yourself with no alternate option, and if your attempts at conciliatory action are in fact exhausted, then listen closely. Attempting to only sink four battleships is far from a brilliant tactical scheme. To truly make the most out of this last resort of attack, you must listen again to the thinkers of the past. As Machiavelli said, If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared (Machiavelli). Right here, Mr. Yamamoto, is where you made your gravest mistake (given your decision to abandon diplomacy). A man who believes he can conquer a moose (or any large animal, for that matter) would never be so foolish as to attack with a sewing needle. The same is true here. If you intend to take a stand against the United States sanctions and interference, then you must hit hard enough that they arent capable of retaliation. While I still think negotiation would be preferable to outright warfare, as Machiavelli says, A battle that you win cancels all your mistakes (Machiavelli). I hope this helps you with your future tactics.
In conclusion, let me remind you of the potential ramifications of these actions that repudiate the pillars of a just war. While your scheme to bomb Pearl Harbor may very well be successful in the short term, I fear for you on a strategic, moral, and political level. I predict that the United States, a previously neutral country, will become hungry to avenge this action. Without an official declaration of war, I foresee this as the irreversible impetus for the US involvement in World War II.
I truly hope you will consider my advice on how to proceed.
Best regards,
Luca Millard-Kish

Economics
H420 - Political Philosophy
	Political philosophy is a field of study based on the formation and critique of systems of complex human relationships that create a government. At its core, philosophy of any brand is theoretical in nature. The relevance of political philosophy is derived from an attempt to put this theory into practice. For the purpose of this writing, a philosophy may be considered unworkable if it has no successful implementation in society. Next, we examine macroeconomic theory, a branch of economics that is concerned with the large-scale issues of the economy as a whole. These two subjects are inseparably intertwined in the fabric of current political systems. But, this begs the question: is the primary goal of the government economic success? This leads to a chicken or the egg scenario where we must ask whether the structure rooted in a chosen political philosophy informs the economic goal or whether the economic goal dictates the political structure best equipped to achieve that. 
	But what if the primary goal isnt even economic success? What if the goal of the union of political philosophy and macroeconomics is to devise a system in which economic success is but a mere byproduct, beneficial nonetheless, of the larger priority of collective happiness? To best go about finding this ideal scenario, we must envision a population devoid of structurea population in the state of nature. The nature of humans in this initial state is debated, but John Locke finds that its A state [...] of equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another [...] (Locke). This suggests that everyone is equal in their uniqueness yet unique despite their equality. This positive view of the state of nature is the ideal first building block of our desired system. Within this framework, everyone has the capacity to function and sustain just themselves, but heres where we can add a new perspective. By introducing the work of Adam Smith, the compounding effects of two great minds may just begin to reach the ideal of collective happiness. Smith suggests that When the whole force of the mind is directed to one particular object, as in consequence of the division of labour it must be, the mind is more likely to discover the easiest methods of attaining that object than when its attention is dissipated among a great variety of things (Smith). This improves Lockes notion that were all equal in the state of nature by allowing specialization that helps us not only sustain our individual selves but innovate as a collective, each contributing our strengths to a greater whole.
	So now, to present a theory of economics and politics that yields the best result, we turn to Finland. This is a country that has topped the worlds happiness rating for the sixth year runningtheyre obviously doing something right. In this system of a Social Democratic Party, all of the citizens share the resources. However, in contrast to the structure of socialisms more extreme cousin, communism, the resources are allocated by a democratically elected state. This ensures representation and appears to allow for a healthy balancing of individual and state power. On the spectrum of macroeconomic theory, this ideology falls somewhere in the middle between communism and complete capitalism. Similar to how the compounded impact of Locke and Smiths ideas created a more effective whole, the borrowing of workable concepts from both ends of the spectrum helps to regulate key aspects of macroeconomic theory to create this socialist democracy. As Adam Smith writes, Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice[...] (Smith). I agree with most of the ideas laid out here, but take challenge when it comes to taxes. I believe that every citizen's contribution (proportional to their income) helps to provide the social amenities that allow a socialist democracy like Finaland to be consistently voted as the happiest country. I have a hard time believing that people in America would be against the government securities afforded by a socialist flavor of economics. However, I think the first step to attaining this new goal of collective happiness (versus purely economic success) is to destigmatize socialism as a concept and distinguish it from strict communism, a system thats proved to be unworkable in practice.

The decision made regarding the Bowers v. Hardwick case violates our duty to the Constitution and its supremacy (Marbury v. Madison). Today the court has brutally attacked the very idea of equal protection which threatens the entire integrity and respect of this court. By viewing this case as an argument of designating a new fundamental liberty over whether the case falls into the fundamental liberty of privacy under equal protection in the 14th Amendment, my colleagues have put historical precedent over the Constitution itself which goes against the supremacy of the Constitution. 
The very question that we were presented with has been entirely misinterpreted. The justices in the majority summarize the case stating, The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy, and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal, and have done so for a very long time (Bowers, 165). While this assertation is true, the court misinterprets the question entirely. We do not need to create an explicit right for homosexual sodomy. To approach the case in this manner completely sidelines the much simpler and obvious solution. Homosexuals have a fundamental right to engage in sodomy, not because the Constitution explicitly says so but because this is protected under the fundamental right to privacy.
The privacy of two consenting adults in their own bedrooms is tightly tied to the idea of fundamental privacy. As established in Eisenstadt v. Baird, If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child (Eisenstadt, 102). Like decisions around procreation, personal intimacy is a matter that also fundamentally affects a person. For many, personal intimacy in the bedroom is one of the deepest ways to achieve emotional intimacy and fulfillment in a romantic and/or sexual relationship. The invasion of this privacy causes such deep psychological harm that the distinction between groups must be so thoroughly sound (such as sex between adults and minors) to be justified. Although homosexual sodomy does not have the ability to procreate as heterosexual vaginal sex does, both homosexuals and heterosexuals engage in sex for purposes other than reproduction, which can be seen through the use of birth control. Reproduction is not any ground to create this legal distinction and is especially unjustified when the governmental intrusion required to enforce the law is so severe. 
To deprive one group of privacy and sexual intimacy and not the other based on mere historical precedent would be ridiculous. The majority conclusion states that A different description of fundamental liberties appeared in Moore v. East Cleveland, where they are characterized as those liberties that are deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition. It is obvious to us that neither of these formulations would extend a fundamental right to homosexuals to engage in acts of consensual sodomy (Bowers, 166). Although historical precedent can be taken into account to aid the understanding of the complexity of an issue, as in Roe v. Wade, it should never be the main holding, especially if historical understandings of the issue have changed dramatically in recent history. Ideas established in the Constitution, such as due process and equal protection, should always triumph over state laws found in our history as these ideas are the building blocks of our democracy. 
At the end of the day, our duty as justices is to consult the Constitution in judging the validity of laws, as so clearly specified in Marbury v. Madison. The courts decision today defiles that duty as it ignores the 14th Amendment when it should so clearly be invoked. Fortunately, we all know that the court is fallible and mistakes can be corrected (as seen in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka overturning Plessy v. Ferguson with the 14th Amendment). I can only hope that future generations will realize this egregious error and restore the integrity of this sacred institution.  Final Essay
H420 - Political Philosophy
EXISTENTIALISM
I - EXISTENTIALISM AND EDUCATION
	After touching on the gamut of philosophical thought that informs politics in different ways, existentialism when framed correctly, seems to have the most potential to create a desirable society. Existentialism, as a philosophy, puts existence before essence. This means that there is no intervention of a higher power that dictates ones essence immediately from birth. In the words of Sartre, [...] man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world  and defines himself afterwards (Sartre). This approach, when put into practice as a political system, would place great importance on educational systems. After all, its through education that one encounters themselves. Learning of the complexities and nuances of a world outside oneself is imperative to the definition of the self. How could one properly define themself if not for their environment, context, and relationships? Through an educational process of self-discoveryincluding education outside that of the strictly academic sensibility (an appreciation of art, culture, and the like)one has the capacity to defy their placement in the sociocultural hierarchy. Access to education is paramount in an existentialist society. Existentialism, often criticized for being a pessimistic approach, is actually quite the opposite, for no doctrine is more optimistic, the destiny of man is placed within himself (Sartre). Let one constantly question, learn, and then question what theyve learned (in a manner similar to that of Socrates) in order to continue their search for essencea component of human identity that is only possible through trial and error, ignorance and learning, and most importantly, self-discovery. The lifelong search for the essence must follow a fundamental notion of existence.
II - MISUSE AND REFRAMING
	However, as intimated in section I, an existentialist perspective rooted in the philosophy of Sartre and Nietzsche isnt infallible. In fact, in certain contexts,  the words of Nietzsche have been warped to be used as a philosophical justification for atrocities far beyond a simple accusation of pessimism. Since Nietzsches admittedly vehement writings dont strictly prescribe an ideal governmental system, they are particularly susceptible to the perversion of a twisted mind. One such example is the notion of the Ubermensch. Nietzsche claims that one of Ubermensch status is guided by some higher morality (often dictated from within the self). However, this very concept has been reframed as permission for violence and dominance. For example, in Germany, under the Nazi Regime, Hitler felt empowered by the actionable message in Nietzsches writing. He contorted this concept of the Ubermensch (a theory intended to refer to individuals) and applied it broadly to all of Germany to create an Ubersociety (ethnonationalism) that aimed to systematically eradicate factions of the population that didnt satisfy certain arbitrary criteria.
	But, just as this philosophy has been misused as fodder for cataclysmic ends, it also has the potential to be reframed from a more positive perspective. At its core, the construction of an Ubermensch is quite existentialist in that it attributes morality (and by extension, essence) to the individual. If we consider the Ubermensch to not be a status for select members of society, but instead an embodiment of what were all striving to become (once weve married our existence to our essence), then we can redefine Ubermensch to represent one who has encounter[ed] himself, surge[d] up in the world  and define[d] himself (Sartre). The Ubermensch can now be seen as someone who is living authentically and specifically as determined by their process of self-discovery (fueled by education and cultural literacy). I emphasize specifically here because the definition of Ubermensch for one person may differ from that of another. In the words of Nietzsche, Those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music (Nietzsche). If we cant understand or appreciate the unique journeys of those around us, then yes, their dancing is bound to appear insane because we dont realize that their music is in fact different from ours.
And again, to redefine certain pillars of Nietzsches work, we turn to the idea of nihilism. Since existentialism rejects all religiously prescribed morals, it has been accused of bruiting a message of nihilism and meaninglessness. However, this too can be reframed as an abundance of freedom (occasionally terrifying, but abundant nonetheless). With this carte blanche attitude, its crucial that we build from a Lockean perspective of the state of nature A state [...] of equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another [...] (Locke). Now, rather than Ubermensch symbolizing power and domination that only some can reach, we can view it as a goal and a malleable term that exemplifies the journey that were all on in striving to ascertain our essencea unique definition of Ubermensch for each person, but not a unique journey in and of itself.
III - THE IMMENSE RESPONSIBILITY AND FREEDOM OF BEING
	Now, in conclusion, this writing begs the question: What will we do with this abundantly free state of being? Where are the limits of our personal moralities and how do they intersect with one another while retaining some semblance of their initial authenticity? If we disregard a higher or divine sense of morality in service to our individuality, then whenever we make a decision and commit to something, were not just deciding for ourselves but influencing the course of events for all of mankind. As Satre says, In such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility (Sartre). The intertwined nature of our society is staggering when fully grappled withso much so that we may very well be rendered catatonic by the sheer weight of our existence. Overwhelming, immense, and filled with responsibility, yet we still must move forward. We still must continue living How? 
	Is it possible to exist without this anxiety? Is this the better way? Sartre claims that There are many, indeed, who show no such anxiety. But we affirm that they are merely disguising their anguish or are in flight from it (Sartre). This suggests that those who seem unscathed by the weight of the world are merely masters of illusion and escape artists. We all live under the same enormity of existence, yet we exist in enormously different ways. As a society, we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial and we have contrived to retain our ignorancein order to enjoy life! (Nietzsche). To recall the concept of Ubermensch, this superficiality works in harmony with the first interpretation of the concept that applauds control and dominance. However, if we pursue our new reframing of Ubermensch as someone who is authentically themselves in a world thats constantly trying to make them otherwise, then this suggests that a true Ubermensch is not blind to the responsibility and freedom of existence, but embraces it (permitted to struggle and overcome along the way). 
 Nietzsche accuses us of existing in a state of strange simplification and falsification, but if we truly want to find our essence, then we must cast off the simplicity and learn to appreciate and thrive within the complexity (Nietzsche). This falsification comes from a belief that our destiny is within the control of some higher being. We view ourselves as subject to the vicissitude of life rather than in harmony with the ups and downs of the journey. Existentialism is optimistic in that it suggests our future is determinable by ourselves. 
Writing Prompt: Liberty and Consequences
H410 - Constitutional Law
What do these cases mean for the origins of the right to liberty?
While constitutional law may appear to be a convoluted web of logic supported by pseudoscientific fact and clarified by increasingly vague and subjective terms, its actually crucial for understanding the origins of our right to liberty. The text of the Constitution and Bill of Rights only explicitly states a few choice rights, but they also acknowledge the Enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people (Amendment IX). With this fundamental understanding, we can view Supreme Court cases as tools (in all their vague glory), to begin to define these unstated yet publicly accepted rights.
To begin to see how this unfolds, consider the case of Lochner v. New York. In this case, the New York Bakeshop Act put a limit on the number of hours that the bakers could work. As this case was decided, the court recognized that this decision hinged on this juxtaposition between The power of the State to legislate or the right of the individual to liberty of person and freedom of contract (Locher v. New York, 36). The case was found to violate the 14th Amendment, and thus secured the right to liberty. In a second example, the case of Myers v. State of Nebraska debated the constitutionality of a Nebraska law that prohibited the teaching of any language other than English. While this law was founded primarily on post-WW1 fear, the court declared that it violated the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment and that Mere knowledge of the German language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful (Meyer v. State of Nebraska, 51). This decision established, among other rights, the right of parents to control their childs upbringing. Lastly, similarly to the educational focus of Meyer, the case of Pierce v. Society of Sisters challenged the Compulsory (public) Education Act of 1922. Building off of the previous Meyer doctrine, the court found this act unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, and further stated that the fundamental theory of liberty in the union excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only (Pierce v. Society of Sister, 56). Its the parents right to educate their children how they see fit in order to prepare them for their individual futures.
In conclusion, we can see that these three cases, although not codified into the Constitution, successfully build definitions of the universally accepted yet undocumented liberties that we possess. The court found that as long as there is no rational basis to exercise police power or restrict these liberties in any way, then they would remain unchallenged and become accepted as Common Law.
Writing Prompt: Liberty and the State
H410 - Constitutional Law
Discuss the idea of public health versus fundamental rights. 
While fundamental rights can and should, on occasion, be restricted in service to public health, the courts rulings of what constitutes public health in the cases Jacobson v. Massachusetts, Buck v. Bell, and Skinner v. Oklahoma are inconsistent and unjustly discriminatory. 
We can agree that citizens have fundamental rights that may not be directly stated in the Constitution, as acknowledged by the ninth amendment. These rights remain untouched by federal law unless theyre in some way posing a threat to public health. But what constitutes a threat to the public? The court errored in the consistency of its decisions regarding public health.
Well begin with Jacobson, a ruling that seems reasonable on the grounds of public health. This is a case concerning mandatory vaccination. In the decision to uphold the states power, the court argued that persons and property are subjected to all kinds of restraints and burdens, in order to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the State [...] (Jacobson). This statement holds true when its referring to the scientifically proven protection against a contagious disease for the public health of society. Its clear cut: if youre vaccinated, you wont contribute to the spread of an illness that threatens the general health of the State.
In contrast to Jacobson, a case directly linked to public health, well now examine the decisions of Buck v. Bell and Skinner v. Oklahoma. In Buck, the court attempted to mangle the definition of public health such that it could be used to justify the forced sterilization of people, specifically women, whom they found to be socially injurious. The court claimed that its in the worlds best interest to not have to wait to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, but rather through the act of sterilization, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind (Buck). However, if this definition of public health held any ground, then the following case of Skinner v. Oklahoma, concerning the sexual sterilization of a man, should have been similarly decided. Are criminals not equally socially injurious if not more than those considered feeble-minded? They arguably cause more explicit damage to society through their actions. But, the court instead argued that [they] are dealing here with legislation which involves one of the basic civil rights of man and that marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race (Skinner). Was this not the case for Carrie Buck, a woman?
This is where the courts definition of public health falls apart. If the decisions of Buck and Skinner were truly concerned with public health, as earlier defined by Jacobson, then their rulings would be more consistent with each other and therefore avoid any speculation of discrimination or unequal treatment, gender-based or otherwise.
In conclusion, the decision in Jacobson was a matter of public health and a reasonable exercise of police power. The decisions in Buck and Skinner, however, cant be justified under the claim of public health and are therefore in direct violation of fundamental rights.

Is there such a thing as crime or not? This has been the topic of the century. Uncovering the nature of crime is a difficult task as it dives into human psychology more deeply than any single man can dive. That is, this fact has now caused a debate to arise in the legal community regarding what causes crime, and if there is such a thing as crime or not. In this context, crime can be defined as an unsanctioned act committed against a legal, religious, or social institution of sorts. In response to the ongoing debate regarding the nature of crime, it has come to my attention that a certain socialist belief is making itself popular, being that crime is a protest against the abnormal structure of society. Even though this may seem like a clever solution to such a complex question, it isnt. Crime has existed since humanities creation, before a structure of society was even created. Therefore crime cannot be a response to the structure of society. In fact, crime has almost nothing to do with society at all and everything to do with the much more complex realm of human psychology and natural law.
Let us begin with what the laws of nature dictate. Ordinary individuals are conservative people by nature, well-behaved, who live in obedience, like being obedient, and have an obligation to be obedient because that is their destiny (286). Obedient individuals are those who follow both the written and unwritten laws of legal, religious, and social institutions. As is expected, these individuals do not have the right to overstep either psychological and legal boundaries because of this obligation, and must live abiding by the laws of nature in order to prevent a disruption in the natural balance.
If this is truly the case, then why does crime exist? In some individuals, a certain playfulness of nature causes them to imagine they arent ordinary, but rather superior to everyone else. It is this mirage of superiority, a natural thought that many unconsciously possess, that causes individuals to, for example, take the lives of others. To someone who possesses such a psychological illness, murder may all of a sudden seem reasonable; I am better than you, therefore I have the right to kill you. Crime is always accompanied by illness. However, criminals never get very far because it is impossible to avoid destiny. Just as mirages are not real, the image of superiority is false, causing an imbalance in the laws of nature: an individual overstepping the destiny they were born with. One might not even bother punishing such a criminal because a correction to rebalance nature is severe enough. [Criminals] will beat themselves up because they are so well behaved. Some will provide this service to others, some will do it themselves (288). This is the beauty of the balance of nature.
Almost every crime can be explained using this psychology. However, an exception can be observed, and the only exception for that matter. From the dawn of humanity, the lawgivers and trailblazers, beginning with the ancients, continuing with Lycurus, the Solons, Mohammeds, Napoleans, and so forth, each and every one of them, were criminals, just by virtue of the fact that in propagating new laws, they were at the same time destroying the old laws viewed as sacred by society and handed down by their fathers (285). However, not a single one of these men experienced the natural punishment for their crimes. In fact, [...] they didnt hesitate even to shed blood, if that blood (sometimes completely innocent and valiantly shed in defense of the old laws) would help them. (285). The only explanation for such a large exception is that it is no exception at all, but rather a whole new law, being that those extraordinary individuals who possess the gift or talent of uttering some new word in their milieu, have not only the right, but the obligation to permit his conscience to overstep various obstacles, and only in the case that the execution of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, one that would benefit all mankind) requires it (285-286). These gifted individuals can be thought of as extraordinary individuals who are destined to propel humanity forward, compared to ordinary individuals who exist solely for the purpose of reproducing the species (286). One can imagine that in nature there are not in fact two categories, but infinite (because defined categories hardly exist in nature). Therefore, I conclude that everyone, not only the great people, but even those who stand out just slightly from the everyday rut, that is, those who are even marginally capable of uttering some new word, must, by their nature, necessarily be criminals (286) and in my opinion, they are even obligated to act accordingly to benefit humanity.

Dear Sir,
I must begin by saying that your bold little article has piqued my interest in the most unique of ways. Sir, if I may, you indeed examine crime and the psychological state of the criminal throughout the crime as the title of your article suggests. However, dear sir, there appears to be just the slightest hint of a rather unique opinion behind your words. Indeed, ...you merely touch on by implication, that there exist in the world certain people, as it were, who are able that is, not that theyre able,  but who have every right to commit any kind of outrages and crimes, and that the laws do not apply to them (284). If I may, dear sir, to my knowledge you claim that there are two distinct categories of men: ordinary and extraordinary. You go on to elaborate that these so-called ordinary individuals are obedient and do not have the right to overstep the common law. This is a rather logical observation, however, good sir, you clarify that the extraordinary individuals have the ability to overstep not only legal but mental boundaries (284). 
If I may, dear sir, I say that this idea is absurd! Although, I must say, that your concept of all the worlds finest men being criminals is rather astonishingly accurate. However, you must realize by now that these so-called categories of yours are not new, in fact it all resembles everything [the educated have] read and heard a thousand times before (289). Furthermore, the thought that some of these extraordinary individuals may even avoid execution for their crimes and rather triumph during their lifetime and begin executing others (who they see as obstacles) is a rather terrifying one (287). This is a dangerous game youre playing, young sir (I assume you are quite young due to the boldness and arrogance of your ideas). What if you are wrong? If these categories are just a figure of the imagination and an individual goes about their life constantly wondering whether they are extraordinary or not, this could be the cause, just say, for example, the individual to commit, lets say, the murder of a pawnbroker just for the sake of proving to himself that he is extraordinary.
This isnt the only fault I see in this theory, however. Sir, if I may just question [...] how does one distinguish the extraordinary people from the ordinary ones? [...] I have in mind that greater accuracy is needed, so to speak, more external distinctions. [...] Because, youll agree, if some confusion results and one of the ordinary category imagine that he belongs to the other one, and begins to eliminate all obstacles, as you expressed it so fortuitously, well then that would be awful (287). In my opinion, and likely the opinion of several other readers of your article, so to speak, The sanctioning of bloodshed as a matter of conscience [...] [is] more terrible than an official or legal sanction to shed blood (288).
 One final thought, [...] when you were composing your little articlecould it possibly be the case [...] that you might also have considered yourself [...] to be an extraordinary man uttering some new word [...] (291). Because if that is truly the case, one could argue your article seems more like a proud and arrogant rant to tend to your insecurities and shadow your humiliation at the thought that you might just be like everyone else.
Respectfully,

What is the Good Life?

My Escape To Berlin
Mother always warned about sleeping across your own reflection, but when it was finally time to position the attic mirror  stained an earthy brown and cracked at the edges  I dragged it across the floor and centered it perfectly between the legs of my bed. The clock blinked 12 :  37 and sitting up, the smell of purple haze and blue twilight reflected off dusty blinds onto my desk and through the glimmer of swirling metal in front of me. A finger pierced the surface sending shock waves in all directions across the spinning universe, sucking the rest of my hand, then my arm and body into the abyss. Catching my last breath I dove in. 
Falling forward I stumble onto an unfamiliar sidewalk, catching myself before I could collapse onto the dark road beneath my eyes. Above me, the great black sky is decorated with an ecosystem of glowing, flickering and fading signs, an endless echoing river of lights. I feel my heels clicking on the ground and brushing my hands on my thighs reveals the rough texture of light washed flared jeans and a thick leather jacket. Like deja vu, I see TERRASSEN AM ZOO in big yellow letters on the imposing grayish green building in front of me. Along the wall, groups of young people sulking, staring, shivering, some exhaling a thin sliver of smoke from their lips into the cold night. Suddenly I felt my body yearning for the soft bed which seemed to pull me deeper and deeper inside every night until I fell asleep. Was I still the same girl who every day after school imagined spontaneously escaping to the big city but inevitably went straight home to obey mothers orders?
 
Ruth!
I turned around to face the never ending road, and a group of teenagers came running towards me dressed in the familiar style of jean jackets and boots, dodging the cars skillfully as if there was a predetermined path for them in space-time. 
We dont have time, we have to go NOW, exclaimed one of the girls under her breath, grabbing my hand and pulling me towards the golden light of the entrance. 
As we were about to cross the rusty barrier I stopped her to ask for her name.
What do you mean, Im Lizzie of course, are you high or something?
Oh and dont forget to bring this,she hands me a ticket made of thick green paper, now come on!
Before I could read it, Im pulled further and stumble into the building which I quickly realized was a train station by the fluorescent buzz, yellow sheen on the tiled floor, layers of graffiti and worn down booths plastered with intricate maps and advertisements. Awkwardly stuffing the paper deep into my front pocket, I notice people, young and old, leaning against the walls, sitting on staircases seemingly leading to nowhere, and huddling together in the thin halls which twist haphazardly. A sea of metal, glass, and concrete opens up before me and even the stink of old pipes and piss cant take away from the sweet taste of total freedom, from my family, from jealousy and delusion, from the panopticon of thought, and the endless hum of suburbia. 
We run together now, pulling each other towards the descending steps to the rows of fading yellow trains. For a moment we all stop, a cool night breeze mixed imperceptibly with the rush of air from the zooming trains. We stood there looking up at the tangled pipes, like intricately woven cloth on a kitchen table. Meeting each other's eyes, we knew we had to carry on. 
The group turned sharply to a back door, revealing a maze of hallways and steps, painted dark blue or black and splattered with sections of purple graffiti and cracks revealing raw concrete. As we went deeper the halls became more crowded until our group could only pass by squeezing through one by one. A sign displayed the word Toilette above a tall door.
Wait here well be back, Lizzie said, turning away.
WAIITT, I practically screamed, Where are you going, I cant do this without you, I blurted out.
You cant  holding my hand in hers and with tears in her eyes, I- youll have to go on your own, remember the ticket? And just like that she swiftly disappeared toward the door.
Someone whispered in my ear, just go on, but when I turned people were rushing past just as before. Those who were stepping out of the door had the familiar gloss over their eyes, some stumbled and fell to the side of the hall. 
Horrified, I ran and ran down hundreds of steps until the walls became thinner and the paint had worn off to merely a pile of dust on the floor. A set of double doors stood before me, the faint sound of people cheering and a booming bass in the background. In a trance, I opened the door and showed my crumpled ticket to the man beside me. Carefully flattening it out, I see at the top:
DAVID BOWIE 77 HEROES
Inside, life moved slowly, strobe lights flickered sporadically across the arena, and the muffled sounds of before drowned out my endless thoughts. My vision blurred into a kaleidoscope of color, mirroring the dance of light and shadow on my desk at dawn. This warm feeling filled me as I glanced towards the shining stage, locking eyes with a boy at the edge of the railing. Without losing this connection, we glide towards each other and his hand travels smoothly from my arm to my shoulder and onto my back.
Remember me? 
Were yo 
Shhh he interrupted me by placing his index finger on my lips.
Please, I must leave this world, this quagmire of endless pleasure and suffering
What do you mean, isnt this what you have always dreamed of?
Is it real?
How do you define real?
Staring into his eyes once more I notice his gaze changes as a reaction to my own change in expression. 
I lean forward to whisper thank you into his ear. Leaving the arena, I repress the urge to look back, a single tear streaming down my face. 
After a single left turn from the exit I came upon the faded sign, this time there was no one in sight. Cautiously I enter this bright room to find Lizzie calmly putting on burgundy lipstick in front of a mirror. 
Lizzie! I cried, collapsing into her arms.
With her ring finger she rubs the top of her lipstick and smudges the color across my lips.
There you go, much better, she smiles, you know it's time...
Staring into the mirror at the dark spot on my lips I shut my eyes, imagining my room just as I had left it. 
Now I lay awake, and all I see is a faint stain of burgundy lipstick on my mirror.

STUDENTS FOR FAIR ADMISSIONS, INC. v. PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE (HARVARD CORPORATION)
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT
[January 24, 2023]
Ms. CHIEF JUSTICE DORESWAMY and Mr. JUSTICE FORSYTHE delivered the opinion of the Court.
I
A
     Affirmative Action policies are designed to create equitable access to educational and employment opportunities to marginalized communities, such as racial minorities. The policy originated with a profound substantial interest in reversing the detrimental effects of racebased discrimination in this countrys history. In the context of college admissions, universities attempt to engineer a diverse class of students in order to reap the educational benefits. However, the implementation of affirmative action policies has been subject to controversy over negative effects on nonminority racial groups, and most recently AsianAmericans. Furthermore Title VI of the Civil Rights Act places all federally funded programs (e.g. private and public universities) to be held liable under the  Equal Protection Clause, and thus strict scrutiny. We note that both the concepts of discrimination and equal protection are subjective: as best proclaimed by Mr. Justice Holmes [a] word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used. Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418, 425 (1918). 
    Affirmative action was first coined in President Kennedys Executive Order 10925 (1961) requiring government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin. While the origin is almost contradictory to its current usage, the purpose remains constant and this nations commitment to establishing a society free of discrimination has only grown. In 1978, the Court decided on University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, establishing the first standard for evaluating a colleges affirmative action admissions policy. The Court acknowledged the State and colleges legitimate interest in the educational benefits of a diverse class, yet ruled against imposing any specific or hard racial quotas. This ruling on allowing the narrowly tailored usage of race was further affirmed in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003).
   Before us now is a challenge to Harvards admission policy as a violation of the Grutter, Bakke, standard and thus Title VI and the 14th amendment. Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. asks us to rule Harvards usage of race as unconstitutional and in violation of the established usage of race due to discrimination against AsianAmerican applicants. Paradoxically, the Bakke precedent was modeled with Harvard Colleges admission process as the gold standard for the appropriate usage of race. On the other side, Harvard maintains that their admissions policy has not evolved since the precedent was established, and is thus in compliance with the narrowly tailored requirement and seeks to uphold their policy. Ibid. Neither the petitioner nor the respondent has argued for the overturning of Grutter or Bakke, but rather a thorough examination of whether the policy complies with or violates the precedent.
II
A
   For nearly 50 years, Harvard Colleges admissions program has stood as the gold standard for racebased admissions. In an appendix to his binding opinion in Bakke, JUSTICE POWELL detailed the merits of Harvards process. He made specific note of the fact that Harvard does not set strict quotas, while nonetheless paying attention to the racial makeup of the admitted class to ensure that they are manifesting their valid interest in a diverse student body.
In Harvard College admissions the Committee has not set targetquotas for the number of blacks, or of musicians, football players, physicists or Californians to be admitted in a given year. At the same time the Committee is aware that if Harvard College is to provide a truly heterogen(e)ous environment that reflects the rich diversity of the United States, it cannot be provided without some attention to numbers. (App. to Brief for Columbia University, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania, as Amici Curiae 2-3. Bakke 317). 
POWELL makes it clear that, contrary to the argument presented by SFFA, the consultation of racial statistics does not imply a quota. Indeed, such consideration may be necessary to ensure that the diversity interest is met. This standard justifies the reports, in which the admissions committee monitors the racial makeup of their incoming class to achieve their ideal racial composition[1]. As Harvard concurs that the majority of their applicants are highly qualified, their usage of race is most likely a plus factor in which admissions officers distribute tips to the applicants with a desirable racial identity (Bakke, SFFA Brief). 
   In their briefing and argument, SFFA makes the assertion that Harvard is in violation of the acceptable mechanisms established in Bakke and then refined in Grutter, which is clearly disproved by the fact that the standard was created to be modeled after Harvards process, and there is no evidence presented that Harvards process has evolved. Therefore, we conclude that Harvard is in compliance with that precedent. 
B
  However, the intent behind the narrowly tailored test established was to eliminate the usage of strict quotas, such as the Medical School of the University of California at Davis reservation of 16 out of 100 seats for students of a racial minority group. Ibid. Despite JUSTICE POWELLs insistence that Harvards policy is not the functional equivalent of the quota but rather a flexible admissions system, the figures provided by SFFA show negligible variance in the percentages[2] of admitted students by race inconsistent with a flexible and nonmechanical use of race (Fig 2 SFFA Brief). The Court in Grutter held that a given schools interest is not simply to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin (Bakke 307). 
   If it looks like a quota, and quacks like a quota, but calls itself narrowly tailored, is it constitutional? Under the standard set in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), disparate impact is discrimination, subject to the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause, regardless of discriminatory intent. We agree. As such, even though Harvard has followed the narrowly tailored standard to the best of their abilities, they are observed to be violating the intent, and thus the central holding of Bakke. Ibid.
C
  In their briefs and in oral arguments, both SFFA and Harvard affirmed that there had been no substantive changes to Harvard Colleges admissions program in the 22 years since Grutter was decided; nor indeed was any evidence presented that indicates that Harvard has substantively altered their admissions program since Bakke highlighted it as a template for how to use race in admissions.
If Harvard College, held by JUSTICE POWELL to be the shining example of a constitutionally viable raceconscious admissions program, is unable to clearly comply with the framework set out in Bakke, despite being in full compliance with the proposed methods of action, we are constrained to conclude that such a framework is fundamentally unworkable. Bakke and Grutter must be overturned. 
III
A
 Having found the Bakke framework unworkable, we must now consider a new path forward.
     The Court has long upheld the use of racial quotas in hiring under Title VII as a constitutionally permissible use of race to further an interest in remedying past harm. In Albemarle Paper Co. v Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975), the Court ordered a company that had, despite no clear discriminatory intent, violated Title VII by underhiring and underpromoting minority applicants relative to nonminority ones based on a flawed general ability testing protocol. The Court held that the testing criteria used by Albemarle, while not facially discriminatory, did systematically underrate minority applicants and was therefore in violation of Title VII. As a remedy, the court required Albemarle to provide back pay for all minority employees deemed to have been harmed from the discriminatory promotion policy, and left the door open for a lower court to prescribe further remedial action.
  In Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1970), the Court determined that the primary aim of Title VII was to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees (Griggs 430). 
   Finally, in a concurring opinion in Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557 (2009), a case dealing with race-based discrimination claims under Title VII, JUSTICE SCALIA wrote that:
Whether or not Title VIIs disparate-treatment provisions forbid remedial race-based actions when a disparate-impact violation would not otherwise resultthe question resolved by the Court todayit is clear that Title VII not only permits but affirmatively requires such actions when a disparate-impact violation would otherwise result. Ibid.
According to Scalia, the Courts holding in Ricci clearly affirmed Title VIIs remedial interest framework as constitutional, and required the use of affirmative action to ensure that interest is fulfilled.
B
   The substantive differences between the text of Title VI and Title VII are small. Title VII deals with employment, while Title VI deals with federally-funded programs generally, but in the context of college admissions these differences are nearly insignificant. In both cases, the question is to what degree and in what manner can applicants be judged based on race. Under both, diversity is seen as a compelling interest that justifies the use of race in admissions. And, given that both were passed at the same time as part of the same law, it is reasonable to assume that the legislative intent behind both is substantively similar; so one might assume that this Court has found similar protections in both. But under Title VII, remedial intent, both on a societal level and as a remedy for harm caused by specific discriminatory practices, is also considered a valid interest; and courts have seen fit in the past to enforce/permit the enforcement of a remedial interest via affirmative action programs. No such judicial precedent exists for Title VI.
   Such variance in the jurisprudences of Title VI and Title VII stems from one decision in particular: Bakke. Indeed, JUSTICES BRENNAN, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and WHITE sought in their opinion to extend the Title VII remedial interest framework to the purview of Title VI; this was rejected by JUSTICE POWELL in his majority opinion. POWELL held that remedial intent was a fundamentally unworkable interest because it requires private entities such as Harvard to make subjective judgements about the relative merits of various racial and ethnic groups claims to historical discrimination and disfavor; in his view, this would be impermissible without judicial or legislative intervention. 
   However, as the minority wrote, [t]he requirement of a judicial determination of a constitutional or statutory violation as a predicate for race-conscious remedial actions would be self-defeating  Judicial intervention is a last resort to achieve cessation of illegal conduct or the remedying of its effects rather than a prerequisite to action. Bakke. A host of Title VII cases support this assertion: McDaniel v. Barresi, supra; Schlesinger v Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975); Califano v Webster, 430 U.S. 313 (1977); Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966). In each, race-conscious remedial actions have been upheld as constitutional without the need for prior judicial review. POWELL improperly disregarded that precedent in declining to extend Title VII jurisprudence to Title VI; today, we reverse that error. 
   We see no reason why the mechanisms of action understood to be permitted by Title VII to remedy systemic and historical harm should not be extended to Title VI; we agree with the primary dissent in Bakke that [n]othing whatever in the legislative history of either the Fourteenth Amendment or the Civil Rights Acts even remotely suggests that the States are foreclosed from furthering the fundamental purpose of equal opportunity to which the Amendment and those Acts are addressed. Bakke, 438 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in part). With that understanding of the judicial precedent underlying Titles VI and VII, we now move to a discussion of the proper use of race under Title VI.
IV
A
   In this case, the explicit purpose of the usage of race in college admissions is to create a diverse class for educational benefits, as race is an indicator of different life experiences for individuals, while not compromising on the high quality of applicants to the highly competitive school in question. Harvard maintains that their applicant pool is oversaturated with Asian American applicants, partially due to cultural factors, comprising approximately eighty per cent, and this accounts for the disproportionality in the demographics of their admitted class. To eliminate the consideration of race in college admissions would lead to classes with a tremendous lack of racial diversity. However, we deny that the established interest of the educational benefits of diversity is solely compelling enough to justify the gray area of racial balancing. 
    This justification is an exceedingly ridiculous one almost akin to giving a child a piece of cake and telling them to eat it off the floor. If Harvard wants cake, i.e. diversity among their students, they should eat it off a plate with dignity, rather than attempting to cloak remedial intent through a definition of diversity that only encompasses race. If the rationale behind the process was to achieve a highly diverse student body, other factors such as socioeconomic status, gender, neighborhood, family structure, ability, creed etc. should be awarded significant consideration. However, no other category constituting diversity comes close to being half as significant as race in the Harvard application process. We concur with SFFAs assertion that Harvards fascination with race indicates substantial external motivation, likely remedial intent. 
   We recognize that substantial progress has been made in reversing the negative effects of racial discrimination, which is the very basis of the arguments of both sides in this case, however we would be wholly mistaken to assert that racial discrimination has been remedied or eradicated from our society. With the integration of race into law, and its ever presence in American society, it is unclear if we will ever be able to fully separate ourselves from this social construct responsible for the most unfortunate aspects of our history. 
    While SFFA asserts that Harvards usage of race results in discrimination against a minority group that the very purpose of such a policy should be designed to prevent, they do not present a workable alternative for the usage of race in the college admissions process, and do not argue for the removal of race in the college application process. We can be confident then that both parties recognize the dangers of color blindness becoming a  myopia which masks the reality that many "created equal" have been treated within our lifetimes as inferior both by the law and by their fellow citizens Ibid.
   We move forward to establish a new workable standard for the usage of race in college admissions, using remedial interest as the justification. Race in college admissions can be used in favoring racial minority groups that have been subject to historical discrimination as both a recognition of the barriers that they may have overcome as a result of their race and an attempt to make higher education, specifically historically elitist and exclusive institutions, more accessible. Race may not be used to contribute negatively to an application, this would eliminate practices such as Havards usage of personal points which clearly illustrates a correlation between Asian American applicants and low personality scores. There is no need for the usage of race to be cloaked, and logically it follows that the same positive consideration would be awarded to any applicant who had to overcome a significant obstacle in their adolescence (e.g. death of a close family member, socioeconomic status, unstable living situation). 
    It does not follow under Harvards purview to meticulously engineer their subjectively determined definition of a diverse class, especially when one considers the universitys investment into reserving seats for recruited athletes, legacies, and  children of major donors. Harvard should solely be concerned with making their admissions process as equitable as possible. The likely impact of this is that the amount of Asian Americans admitted to institutions such as Harvard will increase as the general applicant pool of Asian Americans has high academic and extracurricular qualifications[3].
B
   The language of the 14th Amendment can be described no less than majestic in its sweep: Bakke, 438.
   No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
   Ever since its ratification, the 14th Amendment has been subject to two vastly different interpretations, a raceconscious and raceblind one. One cannot argue that the intent of the amendment was not for remedial interests in an attempt to provide clear guidelines for a new structure of law and society without perpetuating discrimination. Theoretically, the abolishment of race as a societal construct and the control it holds over the livelihoods of persons would be ideal, but to adopt a raceblind interpretation would be foolish at best. 
     In her majority opinion delivered on Grutter, JUSTICE OCONNOR expressed her desire that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today (Grutter 343). While one can share her optimism, the inescapability of our history and continuing presence of racism and bias has justified the indefinite usage of race in college admissions.   We will not establish a termination date for affirmative action policies, and to do so would be egregiously pretentious as to assume that discrimination in this country might someday be completely righted. 
    In a similar vein, we will not act in accordance with a race-blind  14th Amendment, as it does not serve the reality which we abide in and has never been adopted by this Court as the proper meaning of the Equal Protection Clause (Bakke, 355).
   We affirm the present necessity of affirmative action policies and recognize the concerns presented by SFFA surrounding the unintended yet proven negative effects on Asian American applicants. We do not establish remedial measures as an attempt to compare the oppression of minority and disadvantaged groups, nor do we expect colleges to make the highly subjective decisions of weighting the race of their applicants. Furthermore, we concur with  JUSTICE BRENNANS sentiment in Bakke that unlike discrimination against racial minorities, the use of racial preferences for remedial purposes does not inflict a pervasive injury upon individual whites in the sense that wherever they go or whatever they do there is a significant likelihood that they will be treated as second-class citizens because of their color (Bakke 375).
V
     In our overturning of University of California Regents v. Bakke and Grutter v. Bollinger, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to establish Harvard Colleges current and past usage of race in college admissions does not comply with Title VI and Equal Protection. It is therefore our duty to establish the new standard, in which remedial intent feeds a usage of race that places more attention on the applications of those from a racial minority or another disadvantaged group, to account for the unique hardships they might have endured. The case is remanded to the district court with instruction.
It is so ordered.
          Opinion of Mr.  JUSTICE ISERMAN , concurring in part, dissenting in part.
After reviewing the case and all evidence, and the arguments that were given, I have to be against Harvard and affirmative action. The system of affirmative action and race based admissions has proven itself too easy to abuse. This could violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and the civil rights act. The first of which states No state shall  deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws. The latter states No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.. 
With Harvard getting federal financial assistance, they should be held to this standard. Harvard said their admissions help promote diversity, while in fact discriminating against Asian Americans. With the current events, race based admissions matter, due to the tumultuous climate of the situation were in. With the race based admissions in Harvard, it has developed into a problem. With Regents of the University of California v Bakke from 1978,  The University of California was using a quota with 16 out of their 100 slots for qualified minorities. 
Bakke had qualifications exceeding those who got the slots and was rejected since he was white. The quota system was ruled to have violated the Civil Rights act of 1964. This ties into Students For Fair Admissions v Harvard because as was mentioned in the oral arguments, 80 percent of Harvards admissions are from people of Asian origin, while only about 20 percent of the student body is of Asian origin, so they are most likely enforcing a quota, despite it encouraging diversity. Unless there is definitive proof of the quality of applications  being less than others, the only possibility is a quota being in place to prevent this. 
However with Fisher v. University of Texas, Texas law dictated that the university of texas would need to admit all high school seniors who were in the top 10 percent of their high school. However the top ten percent wasnt diverse, and Fisher, a white student, was not admitted. The court ruled in favor of Fisher and that race based admissions must be precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest and that if thats not met, race shouldnt be considered. 
Another case on race based decisions is Yick Wo v Hopkins, where an 1880 San Francisco ordinance required permits for laundries in wooden buildings, and despite most of the laundries being operated by Chinese Americans, none were granted permits. This law was overturned because a law that is not inherently discriminatory, but is enforced in a discriminatory way is unconstitutional, because it violates the equal protection clause. This applies to admissions because even if the method of admissions used is impartial, but is applied with a discriminatory intent, it would be against the equal protection clause. 
Another example of potential discrimination in schools was brought up in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, where the case of public school funding being from property taxes, and since minorities are often in poorer neighborhoods, their schools would get less funding. This case was ruled that the method of funding was not unconstitutional since The Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages. (Rodriguez). 
This ties in since the cases should be based in some equality, even if its not equal. However when a vast majority of the denied applicants are of one race, its almost certain that the standards are nowhere near equal, hence theyre unconstitutional. And then with Grutter v. Bollinger, the case was determined that race could be used as a factor in college admissions, as long as it doesnt harm minority candidates. Harvard was used as a positive example for this situation, since at the time in 2003, they had a positive admissions system. 
However now Harvards admissions system has proven an undue burden on minorities. Since the diversity in the student body does not reflect the diversity in the applications, there has to be some sort of discrimination involved. Affirmative action has proven itself time and time again to be rife for abuse by colleges to filter out certain races. With this, there has to be some sort of method to make sure the admissions system is impartial and non discriminatory. There are some methods that might be used to bypass this requirement, however those methods need to still be constitutional under Yick Wo, since the use of admissions wasnt initially discriminatory, however the system of personal scores that was given in interviews is inherently discriminatory against Asian Americans, since they tend to score lower on it as a trend despite having a high academic score that would likely get them admitted if it wasnt for the interview. 
Because the personal score is dependent on the interviewer, just like the permits for laundries in San Francisco. With those the permits had to be given individually, and the permits werent given to any Chinese Americans, despite the majority of the laundries being run by them. This is similar to Harvard and the application process because a vast majority of the applicants are Asian American and have strong academic scores, yet theyre denied due to the opaque process of personal scores that are given to the interviewer. So this method of college admissions is unconstitutional due to the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the constitution.
   Opinion of JUSTICE OMENN, concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
   The parts of this decision that I concur with are important points that this Court should have recognized. However, the manner in which this Court has decided to remedy the previous errors of the Court is frankly, insane. I concur that as shown above, the admissions process used by Harvard systematically discriminates against asian applicants. Given how the Harvard plan bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003) and yet clearly discriminates against a minority group, the decisions made in Grutter and Bakke should be overturned. Reversing Grutter and Bakke as well as acknowledging that the 14th Amendment has to be race-conscious as opposed to race blind in order to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) are agreeable. As stated in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. This importance extends to the federal level as well, with the federal government giving Harvard tens of millions of dollars in grants and endowments. Private institutions such as Harvard are given large amounts of federal funding to give the highest quality education possible to its students.  The students who apply should not worry that their race will disadvantage them in the application process.
    What I disagree with in the majoritys opinion is their solution of how colleges can avoid discriminating against historically underrepresented groups. The majority here propose that we accept quotas as a part of title VI, and use them as a semi-permanent basis in college admissions. What the majority is doing here is creating the most egregious case of judicial lawmaking ever had in this court. While Bakkes unworkable opinion needs to be changed, re-writing a section of the civil rights act and overturning 40 years of precedent is too far. Institutions of higher education and jobs are not the same thing. What this decision is allowing is for any educational institution to outright discriminate against any group based on race using the justification of remedial interest 
    As this case is decided, it fails the five point checklist for the removal of Stare Decisis. As given in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, 517 U.S __ (2022) the five factor used when determining if Stare Decisis should be overturned are [t]he nature of the Courts error[,] [t]he quality of the reasoning[,] Workability[,]  [e]ffect on other areas of law[, and]  [r]eliance interests. 
    Firstly, there is the nature of the Courts error. The Court has erred by resorting to judicial intervention, a last resort to achieve cessation of illegal conduct or the remedying of its effects (Bakke.) Instead of letting the state and federal governments try to handle the issue of quotas in universities, this Court has raced ahead of them all and declared that yes, quotas are the new standard. To uproot decades of judicial and legal precedent only to dictate what the replacement would be in the same decision is a serious error.
  Secondly, there is the quality of reasoning in the decision, focusing mainly on the connection between title VII of the civil rights Act and title VI. The majority makes the case that because quota systems are applied under title VII, they should be under title VI as well. What the majority fails to mention, however, is that the federal government has signed laws and executive orders supporting the idea of quotas and affirmative action present in the workplace, yet has done no such thing in regards to public or private universities. The majority would close the distinction between title VII and VI of the civil rights act without any party remotely interested in such an action. 
   Thirdly, there is the workability of this decision. This Court would have remedial interest, a temporary interest by its nature, made the standard with only the confidence that somewhere down the line, a different Supreme Court will overturn the interest of remedial action. Decisions made in this Court are not meant to be temporary, they are meant to set precedent that is easy to follow and understand, to interpret the Constitution in a consistent manner. This decision has a solution as workable as the solution in Bakke, and as seen by this court, the Bakke solution is unworkable. If the solution found in Bakke is unworkable because it gives a vague standard of narrowly tailored, the decision by this court is even worse, it tells colleges to actively discriminate against various races based on perceived past hardships. The same problems encountered at Harvard now could be encountered just the same with this decision. If the Harvard admissions office decides that the past hardships of asians and asian americans was not that serious, those applicants could find themselves once again disadvantaged on a basis of race.
   Fourthly, the effects this decision would have on other areas of law needs to be considered. Title VI does not only apply to discriminatory practices in universities, but in any institution that receives federal funding. Racial quotas and discriminatory practices could be used not only in universities across the nation, but in healthcare services, social services, and other federally funded programs could all find themselves having to change whatever policies they had to incorporate the remedial interest present in righting historical disadvantages. This not only creates chaos as a variety of services across the country try to change their codes, but this decision also creates areas of uncertainty between one government funded program and another, solely depending on how great the remedial interest in righting historical wrongs is. 
   Lastly, the reliance interests present in this case. As mentioned above, overturning Grutter, and Bakke not only changes the admissions spectrum for universities across the nation, but changing the definition of title VI of the civil rights act causes havoc for any agency receiving federal funds. 
   This Court has been given an inch and taken a mile. Drastically upending decades of judicial precedent only to replace it with a solution both unworkable and widely damaging to a myriad of institutions in this nation. Jumping straight to the last resort of judicial intervention, and participating in judicial lawmaking. This Court has taken a wrongly decided precedent, and somehow made it even worse for everyone. 
   Given all of the concerns I have with this decision, I respectfully dissent. 
  
------------------------------------------------------------
[1]Shields, a former admissions officer at the Law School at the University of Michigan testified in Grutter that he frequently consulted daily reports which informed him of the racial and ethnic composition of the classto
ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be reached. It was ruled that such consultation did not meet the definition of a racial quota.
[2] In evaluating the usage of race in the University of Michigans admissions process, Justice OConnor wrote that the percentages of minority admits varied from 13.5 to 20.1 percent, a range inconsistent with a quota (Grutter 336). When compared with the figures provided by SFFA, which show flexibility in percentages of ~2%, Harvards system much more closely resembles a quota, though not a hard quota (SFFA Brief). 
[3] In data gathered from 19952013 published by The Harvard Crimson, Asian American admits were shown to have the highest SAT scores out of any racial group, an average of 767 across all sections. In comparison, white admits earned an average score of 745, HispanicAmerican admits earned an average of 718, NativeAmerican and NativeHawaiian admits an average of 712, and AfricanAmerican admits an average of 704.Although The Wretched of the Earth is a modern work which is grounded in colonial realities of the current era, it is undoubtedly building off of previous works of political philosophy. In many ways, the wretched of the earth is the antithesis to previous works, by speaking from the non-white, colonized perspective. If and when colonialism has been mentioned in previous works, it almost exclusively is described as a theoretical concept, from an outside, privileged perspective. For example, in Machiavelli's The Prince, he lays out the steps that a ruler must take in order to capture and maintain power of foreign land and its people. The torture, slavery, and murder of the colonized people are mentioned in passing, and matter-of-factly. Fanon flips this idea and instead describes in detail not just the material but the psychological impact of colonialism on the colonized. Although Fanons work may seem more relevant to the present day, the more abstract works provide an important framework for understanding Fanon, specifically how different theories on mans state of nature inform the ethos and therefore behavior of the colonizers. 
Although the state of natureof man, how a person is, behaves, thinks, etc., has been implied in various philosophical works, Hobbes and Locke are some of the first philosophers to write concrete theories on how humans would behave outside the constraints and forces of society. Locke believed that the state of nature would be relatively peaceful, but that society can provide additional security and benefits for the price of giving up some freedoms. From his The Second Treatise on Human Government, he states The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which [] teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions. Therefore, he believes that if humans are left alone they will see more benefit in being considerate of others and act accordingly. However, Hobbes believed the opposite, that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war is of every man against every man (Leviathan). In this state of nature there would be no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society and human life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short (Leviathan). These opposing views are critical to understanding the psychological and philosophical basis for the colonizers treatment of the colonized.
In Fanons The Wretched of the Earth, the colonizers view the colonized much the same way as Hobbes describes the state of nature. Fanon writes that colonized  society  is  not  merely  portrayed  as  a  society  without values [...] The  native  is  declared  impervious  to  ethics,  representing  not  only  the absence  of  values  but  also  the  negation  of  values (page 6). Not only do the colonizers view the colonized as having no morals, but as being outside of morals. This reflects Hobbes idea that the state of nature is a place of total chaos without values, which presupposes an absence of society and culture, thereby stripping the native people of their humanity. In fact, when  the colonist  speaks  of  the  colonized  he  uses  zoological  terms (page 7). This shows that the colonizers regard the colonized as being in the state of nature (essentially like animals), and are using Hobbes theory to justify (perhaps on the subconscious level) their oppression on another race of people. Fanon later writes that  colonization  has  succeeded  once  this  untamed  Nature  has  been  brought  under control (page 182). This clearly connects to the central idea of the Leviathan, which explains that a strong centralized government is required to tame human nature into a peaceful, livable society. In this framework, the colonized are simply doing their part in creating better conditions for the natives to live in a more secure society. This explains the tight militaristic control, introduction of western values through education and dismissal of local cultures. Whether or not Hobbes state of nature is an accurate theory, colonizers have used it to justify their brutal and unwarranted treatment of other people. 
In the modern day, it is easy to suggest that colonizers unfairly subjugated and repressed native peoples. But under a very simple and seemingly plausible theory, the colonizers behavior can be more easily understood. However, the validity of this theory is never questioned, and most importantly, the fact that the natives live in the state of nature is never questioned. Upon confrontation with non-western society, the colonizers deem others as more primitive for superficial differences in behavior, dress, and infrastructure. Thus, Hobbes theory from the Leviathan is used more as a justification for the colonizers, and shows the danger of using, albeit important, philosophical theory in practice.Sarah Epelbaum

Oedipuss Inevitable Hamartia
In the Aristotelian definition of tragedy, a character's flaw, or hamartia, is what leads them closer to their fate. A tragic hero is one who realizes their hamartia too late and cannot mend their mistakes by changing their actions. This is not the only aspect of a tragic hero, but for the sake of the argument I will be primarily focusing on this criteria. In the classic Greek play Oedipus Rex, Sophocles subverts this structure by showing only the recognition and reversal, without portraying the actions of him completing his fate (killing his father, and marrying his mother). Essentially, at no point in the play could Oedipus have avoided or changed the inevitable recognition that his fate had come true. In fact, his persistence to understand his birth story expedited the process of finding the truth. By contrast, the play Macbeth delineates the mental and physical circumstances that lead to Macbeths fall, and change to bad fortune. Apart from Oedipus having no chance of changing his mindset to avoid future mistakes, his predetermined fate was immoral to begin with. Throughout the history of civilization, most cultures have seen incest and murder (particularly of the kind described in the play) as a clear line to not be crossed. The gods essentially damned Oedipus from birth by giving him this fate which would make a person bad from an ethical perspective. Since Oedipuss fate was flawed, he could not have made any errors of judgment throughout his life. Thus, Oedipuss hamartia was predetermined by his fate. 
First, we must establish what Oedipuss hamartia is to begin with. Towards the beginning of the play, the chorus plays a major role in establishing and expanding upon the plot and underlying themes. It is clear from what the chorus is explaining that Sophocles intended for Oedipuss hamartia to be hubris or excessive pride, meaning belief in himself over the forces of the gods or nature. The chorus sings, pride breeds the tyrant violent pride, gorging, crammed to bursting with all that is overripe and rich with ruin- clawing up to the heights, headlong pride crashes down the abyss- sheer doom (963-967). Here it directly states that Oedipuss (the tyrant) problem is his hubris. Moreover, his pride is violent because he is willing to do extreme and dangerous things such as solving the sphinx's riddle and kill Laius because of his pride. He is clawing up to the heights because his status has increased up to a king, and he eventually crashes down metaphorically when he finds out the truth. The quote shows how this headlong pride will lead him to fall down from his high status. Poetics describes the tragic hero as one of those people who are held in great esteem and enjoy great good fortune and turned from good fortune to bad fortune- and this must be due not to depravity but to a serious error which Oedipus perfectly embodies with his high status and erroneous hubris (Aristotle 21). The connection between Oedipuss pride and his eventual downfall cannot be understated, as this hamartia forms the basis of how he came to complete his fate. 
In the middle of the play, Oedipus comes one step closer to finding his true identity when he exposes that he did in fact kill a group of people on a triple crossroads, like the prophecy proclaimed. He explains that the driver was about to thrust me off the road to which he replied I strike him in anger  I paid him back with interest (891-894). This moment shows how his stubbornness of not letting someone pass on the road before him led to a violent result. His hubris clouded his judgment and he was unable to let go of his pride, acting irrationally instead of analyzing whom he was killing or the consequences. Later in his explanation he even states that by god he killed the king with one blow of his staff, implying that the gods had made it unusually easier for Oedipus to kill him (895). Since Oedipuss fate was inescapable from his birth, he was bound to kill his father one way or another. No rational person would kill their father knowingly, but even without that knowledge, Oedipus was bound to kill someone. Since killing is an immoral act in and of itself, Oedipus, who was born to make this grave mistake, must have been born with a flaw which could rationalize a murder. How this flaw manifests itself to lead to him killing his father is irrelevant, but having some kind of hamartia is inescapable. In this story, his hubris led him to kill his father, but I suppose that in a parallel universe some other hamartia could have created the circumstances for completing his fate. Thus, I believe that Oedipuss hamartia was predetermined along with his fate. 
Right before Oedipus accepts his fate, the shepherd reveals that the baby that he saved was in fact Oedipus, proving that Jocasta was his mother. His last words reveal the truth about Oedipuss life at large. He states that if you are the man he says you are, believe me, you were born for pain implying that Oedipuss suffering was inevitable (1304-1305). By contrast, the messenger states that the pains we inflict upon ourselves hurt most of all, but was his pain really self-inflicted if he was born to bear this pain (1360-1361)? Thus these two opposing ideas create an oxymoron in which Oedipus was both fated to have pain, and this pain was self inflicted, implying that it came internally from his hamartia. This means that the gods indirectly gave Oedipus a hamartia through his immoral fate. This is confirmed when characters that opposed Oedipus now could not help but feel pity for him. When Creon comes to Oedipus after he goes blind he explains that I havent come to mock you, Oedipus, or to criticize your former failings reassuring Oedipus that he is not to blame for the actions related to his fate (1557-1558). The chorus asks, what god, what dark power leapt beyond all bounds, godforsaken, cursed you wretched life (1435-1438)? This indicates that perhaps the god was actually dark power, because this fate was more like an evil curse than anything else. Both with the understanding that Oedipus was cursed from birth and that his pain was inevitable and self inflicted, we can conclude that Oedipuss fate must have included a hamartia. 
From the perspective of the reader of Oedipus Rex, Oedipuss excessive pride and inability to see other points of view are obvious. What is most tragic is that in Oedipuss prior worldview, his actions make rational sense and are believable to the modern viewer. But by omitting the truth of his identity and thereby mistaking his relationships for what they are not, he leads an immoral life. With such a depressing and twisted story, one must wonder the intent of broadcasting this particular story to the masses (via a play). This inability to see the truth, one that has been waved in front of our faces, and falsely believing in your own opinions over others is a universal experience across cultures. Our human nature leads us to avoid that which is uncomfortable and which requires a total reevaluation of our existence. By taking this theme to the extreme, Sophocles shows the extent to which this hubris can lead down a path of destruction, prompting a reflection of the possibility of our own flaw that may be glaringly obvious to everyone except for ourselves. More importantly, is this flaw something that we were bound to have acquired, much like traits acquired from childhood trauma, or is it our own doing. My conviction is that our flaws are partially predetermined, but by consuming art such as Oedipus, we can begin the process of purification of our hamartias before they lead us down a destructive path.

ST. PETERSBURG, THURSDAY , 27 JULY 1865 A SPECIAL REPRINT OF
by Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov
NO. 1000
We find Russia now in a revolution of conscience accompanied by a bitterly frustrating material sameness. As the aristocracy rises further above the  ground,  and  as  the newly-liberated peasantry is further interred beneath the dirt, we are forced to consider more deeply the relationship between citizen and country. A primary facet of this relationship is the invention of law (and, consequently, crime), the mechanism by which a government maintains power by regulating the behavior of its men.
First, it is necessary to state that crime is defined in two senses: legal crime, simply that which is prohibited by the governing body, and moral crime, that which is in defiance of nature. Violent crime, which will be the primary focus of this article, is oft considered the
most offensive act of criminality, both in a legal and moral manner; not only an affront to social order but  also  a  betrayal  of  our
instinctual and aesthetic senses. And yet blood is shed and continues to be shed, it flows and has flowed on earth, like a waterfall, which has been poured out like champagne.1 It is worth noting, too, that many trailblazers of humanity were particularly horrible shedders of blood,2 for which they were crowned on the Roman Capitoline and designated benefactors of mankind.3 How is it then, that this crime is both condemned and extolled? How is it that violent transgression is both antithetical and essential to the functioning of mankind? The resolution to this apparent impossibility lies in the psyche of the criminal himself.
In			observing				 those	 who commit such crimes we generally find two classes of men. The first, and			 the			 most		common,				are comprised of those for whom crime is accompanied by a psychological illness  a fixation of some kind  which develop[s] gradually, and reach[es] its climax not long before the	 execution	 of	 the			crime;			[it] continue[s] in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for	some		time		 afterward,	and, depending		on			the		individual4 either			passes	away			or	becomes chronic. This illness is the root of the apparent carelessness which we can discern when examining the most common type of crime. Why does		a		criminal,	we			might		ask, forget a crucial piece of evidence? Why			does		he		flee		the scene so hastily, when nothing external seems to force him to do so? The answer to these questions is that there exists a kind of internal nervous pressure that guides the movement of the criminal and overrides his rational thoughts in the moment of action, which itself becomes the perpetrator of the crime and the spiritual inhabitant of  the  criminal.  This  sudden failure of willpower and reason, overtakes  the  body,  causing phenomenal        childish thoughtlessness, precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed.5 The illness is an entity outside of the self, a virus that infects the mind and compels it to betray itself. We call this illness guilt.
But this squeamish cowardice
and its resultant carelessness is symptomatic only of the first (and, as we are to discover, inferior) type of criminal. The second category
is comprised of the trailblazers and lawmakers,		who	are			praised		for their achievements, either in spite of or because of their violent crimes. For are we to believe that Napoleon was tortured by guilt? If Napoleon had		been		nothing		but		a		lowly criminal, we would have nothing left to say of him today. But we pore over him, his life, his character, his achievement,		and		 especially	his crimes. These men, Napoleons, are thus necessarily above the affliction of guilt and are able to retain reason and willpower and carry out crime without			incident,		 in			its			 perfect form.6	It is not wrong to say that for	the		 first			 man,		 the	ordinary criminal,			an				act		of			 murder		is incongruent					with			his			greater purpose		of			reproduction, and is thus unnatural. He has, in effect, committed both a moral and legal crime. But for the second man, the extraordinary criminal, there is no such incongruence, and hence no such discomfort. His purpose is to drive society forward, and, indeed, violence and bloodshed has proven to be the language of progress. The extraordinary  mans  crimes  are therefore only crimes in a legal sense, and prove to be necessary for the greater good.   The first category always comprises men of the present; the second, men of the future,7  and crime is thus as natural to the extraordinary man as obedience is to the ordinary. Such is the natural order of things, and such should be the rule in a new, progressive Russia: wherein the ordinary  are  obligated  to  be obedient  because  thats  their destiny, and the extraordinary initiate the destruction of the present  order  in  the  name  of something better:8 a new order, a new Russia, a New Jerusalem.9

Still, the fundamental problem
On Crime
by Porfiry Petrovich
On Crime, by Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov,					meditates				on		the nature of crime and the function of guilt		in		 the					salaciously		tangled political,				philosophical,				and physical landscape of contemporary Russia.		I				suppose			its			 not surprising that this little article fascinated me, as a police inspector, merely	by		 way		of	its				unique assertion		 that			the				 act			of committing			a			crime		is				always accompanied			by		[an]		 illness,10 which causes a criminal to make otherwise		inexplicable			mistakes. But I must confess, my fascination with	the piece goes beyond the nature  of  my  profession  I recognize in the writing a certain youthful, idealistic fervor. In the very rhythm of the words I can sense the authors urgency; I can feel the incessant cramping in his hand as he goes on writing even as his words run into each other; hear the racing and pounding of the heart11   as  he  wipes  the perspiration from his furrowed brow; I can see the subtle smirk that transforms his face as he pens a particularly biting line. There is something undeniably endearing in that  first,  ardent,  youthful literary effort.12 In this case, I was especially  taken  by  the  idea mentioned at the end of the article, [...] that there exist in the world certain people [...] who have every right  to  commit  any  kind  of outrages and crimes, and that the laws do not apply to them.13 This proposition    is    especially demonstrative of the unavoidable vice of the aforementioned naive enthusiasm  that is, excessive egoism.
I shall not attempt to be too thorough in my analysis of the faults of the theory itself, which are numerous and glaring, for that constitutes a fundamental misapprehension of the nature of this article  which is not to be considered a serious piece of work.
with the theory, the question of how we can distinguish the extraordinary from the ordinary,14 is at the heart of the whole matter. There is nothing to stop an ordinary man from convincing himself or, more essentially, convincing others, that he is extraordinary. And, if the power is put in the hands of the men themselves to claim that coveted right to transcend the law, couldnt this imposter then claim his right and go on to remove all obstacles blocking his way15 in pursuit of his farcical visions for the future? Whats to stop Russia from falling victim to hundreds of these ecstatic false idols? For, truly, who among us in Holy Rus doesnt consider himself a Napoleon these days?16 In fact, I even wonder if this was also the conviction of our own Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov in writing this very articleif, excited by the novelty of his own thoughts thereby consumed by themif he might also have considered [himself], even the tiniest bit, to be an extraordinary man uttering some new word.17
Let us return to our image of		the				 young				Raskolnikov, toiling away on his article, each second		 more				frenzied					and irritated				with			a		 self-satisfied nervousness	and		 glee,		as			he articulates the theory on which he	has		predicated			his			entire being. In his own mind, the act of writing this article is its own peculiar			transgression,	 which, though not fully realized, marks him			as	brimming		with			 latent greatness. Such is the defect of all such			young		Schillers:18			 the willingness				 to					believe wholeheartedly		in			their				own greatness. These are blind men who purport to see what they cannot,	who insist on acting beyond their rank and ability, who claim to know the truths of right and wrong. Raskolnikov, in being  one  of  these  men, dismantles  his  own  theory effortlessly, with no need for my embellishment!

I,	Andrey	Semyonovich Lebezyatnikov, with the help of a several other educated and highly progressive individuals, am organizing one such commune, which is to be located somewhere on Meshchanskaya Street.33 We are looking for more people to join us in this noble endeavor. I myself am even willing to educate any prospective members on these complicated matters so as to further incite their protest.34 If interested, please reach out to me, Lebezyatnikov, at my residence at Amaliya Ivananovnas.

Th ur sday
On Cr ime
I write to you today	to	share my thoughts		on		the psychological state of a criminal during the commission			of	 his crime .1 Some readers may throw			up their hands in protest as they		read				about crime,									an
overstepping	of common laws, but I aim to inform you of the reasoning and perhaps right of the criminal to comport themselves in such a manner as to be considered
criminal . As a deep thinker and former
overstep			 the						 law, because, dont					you see, theyre ordinary . But			extraordinary people have the right to commit all sorts of crimes						and								to overstep					 precisely because							theyre extraordinary					(284). In				a								 sense, extraordinary			people have		the			right					 to permit												[their] conscience														 to overstep				various obstacles,and only in the	case		that					the execution		 of						their idea						(sometimes, perhaps,			one				that would				benefit						all

Bridges represent a change: Even his glum mood had passed; there was no trace of the former energy hed felt when hed left home to end it all (188).
law student, Ive come to discover and name an observable truth about the nature of humanity . There exist, in this world, two types of people: those who are ordinary, and those who	are
extraordinary . I believe that ordinary people must live in obedience and do not have the right to
mankind) requires it
(285).This		comes down to the question of whether one bad deed is balanced out by the multitude		of good				it			 would provide .				And				I believe, if the person acting			with			some potential			violence is truly	extraordinary, then their actions can be justified		by		the larger benefit to
society.
But, don t take my word for it. Lets examine some of the extraordinary figures fr om history in hopes of understanding the truly revelatory ideas that justify, or could justify	seemingly violent actions. Take Kepler or Newton for example. Th ese two brilliant minds were,
in a way, compelled to spread their new word of scientific discovery to the world. Anyone who doubted,
contradicted,	or interfered with their ideas	therefore purely hindered the dissemination of world- shattering 
new insight. Th ese extraordinary

Ever y new idea t h at disr upt s t h e nat ur al or der of societ y is seen as cr imin al in it s newness.
scientists then have a right, or even an obligation, to share their new word with the worldeven if this means the elimination of those in their way. Th is notion, however, isn t new. We can trace it back to ancient leaders such as Lycurgus, the Solon, Mohammed,
Napoleon, and the like. Ever y new idea that disrupts the natural order of society is seen as criminal in its newness. But to this, I respond that, of the two categories of men (ordinary	and extraordinary), Th e fir st category always comprises men of the present; the second, men  of  the  future
(286).Th e trailblazers of humankind that pushed society
forward were often quite egregious blood shedders, but does that mean that wed rather give up all of the new ideas that they brought to society? Would we rather remain in an ordinary rut where everyone is too scared to disrupt the present,
compromising the potential of the future? Th e criminals of one time and place, with the passage of years, decades, and centuries, become the heroes	and
revolutionary
intellectuals	of another time.
Now, dear Reader, if you still fin d yourself unsure how you fit into this matrix of humanity, I urge you to consider these definitions. In order to distinguish
between the two types of people, we must examine how they fit into the fabric of society. Th e ordinary category consists	of
conservative people by nature, well- behaved, who live in obedience and like being obedient (286). Th ey don t even fin d this	obedience humiliating since its so deeply ingrained in their nature.2 In contrast, the second category of truly extraordinary people consists of people who break the law, destroyers			or, judging by their abilities,		those predisposed to be so (286). Again, one must remember, if you fin d yourself identified				as
extraordinary, or even as one of the endless subdivisions
between	the		two ways of being, your end goal must justify your	action	in		its betterment of society.
Therefore, with this understanding, I conclude			that everyone, not only the great people, but even those who stand out just slightly fr om the everyday rut, that is, those who are even marginally capable of uttering some new word, must by their nature, necessarily be criminalsmore or less, it goes without saying (286). Those who are part of an unusually	small number3 of people must be able to permit		their conscience to wade through blood4 if it is a direct means to attain their goal (th at is of the right nature and dimensions, of course).

On On Cr ime
My name is Porfiry Petrovich, and Im the magistrate leading the investigation into the murder of pawnbroker, Alyna Ivnovna.
Throughout my years of work and during this		particular investigation, Ive become intimately aware of the subtle nuances of a troubled criminal mind. So, as you might imagine, a certain			article published in this very paper, by the name of On Cr ime, quite piqued my interest.7 Th is article by a self- proclaimed pundit, anonymously signed R.R., discussed, in astonishing detail, the psychological state of a criminal during their crime. In addition, the article went	on		to wholeheartedly
such criminal actions as long as theyre carried out by one deemed
extraordinary. Th is distinction between ordinary	and extraordinary is bold, and I applaud the courage it takes to make such a statement, but Im afraid this overly straightforward 
delineation between members of society isn t quite as revolutionary and foolproof as the author claims.
Now,
dear R.R., I speak directly to you, sir. First of all, while you appear to be acting within your own ideal matrix by spreading this new word,	the
unfortunate truth is that these concepts are verisimilar to notions that have been bruited many times befor e now.8
To that end, what is really original? Is it only an original, or dare I use your terminology,    new
word that so conveniently
provides the right to mow down others in an effor t to spread it (288)? If this is as you say, sir, I fear that the most natural next question is: what happens if some confusion results and one of the ordinary category imagines that he belongs to the other one, and begins to elim inate all obstacles (287). If one, either with reason or purely fr om self- entitled whim sy, begins to believe that they have the rights youve enumerated above, how must we, mere	plebeians, distinguish between those who are truly extraordinary and those who are too
blind to see that they hardly  stand  out fr om the hoi polloi? 9
To that end, permit me to present a silly and playful idea that I can t seem to purge fr om my mind after reading your little article. Sir, excuse me for potentially being too upfront, it is after all in my job description,	but might I query that wh en you were composing your little articlecould		it possibly be the case [...] that you might also have considered yourself, even the tiniest bit, to be an extraordinary man uttering some new word  [...]  (291)?
Upon reaching this conclusion, I would assume that your natural next thoughts might be that you yourself had an obligation,	and therefore a right, to overstep obstacles, circumstances, and constraints in an effor t to benefit mankind.10
Please
do not misconstrue my intentions by proposing such a chimerical
possibility. However, if this does happen to
p.5| 03.23.2023 | Thursday	l uca mil l ar d-kish
be the casethat youve gone ahead and overstepped such ordinary
limitations 			I		do partly				understand where youre coming from .			Upon				first reading, I ridiculed 11 your little article, but the truth is, that Im familiar 12 with		 some of	those ideas and feelings. And so, in conclusion,	 I		write this		response as a word		of	warning about the dangers of this						proud
suppressed enthusiasm13	that oozesfrom your
florid and persuasive lexicon (497). Your article   is   well
written a    good
article,		 I				 must admit but it reeks of ignorant, young, and incorruptible				pride buried	within			an absurdly			fantastic notion .14 Pleasethink things				through rationally		if			it		isnt already too late.

E400: Great Works of Literature
16 December 2022 
Macbeth Would Ignore His English Teacher 
Decisions are made every day, a thousand times over. Babies decide what foods they like and dislike. Adults decide where they want to live and work. High schoolers writing essays decide on topics, word choice, and whether or not they want to listen to the advice of their English teachers. English teachers decide to give their students bad grades if their essays lack explication. Some decisions are less important, like what one should eat for breakfast, while others have a more impactful effect on ones life. Therefore, hand-in-hand with decision-making comes the stress of deciphering whether one is making the right choice. As a result, countless attempts have been made to provide others with lessons on how to know if a choice will have a positive or negative result. We can see these themes appear in theater, even dating back to ancient Greece. Aristotle believed that the point of theater is to teach audiences how to respond to different situations. In watching fictional characters make mistakes and suffer from them, the hoi polloi can learn how to avoid making similarly misguided decisions. Plays that teach these lessons are called tragedies, and they emphasize the idea that some characters (tragic heroes) have a fatal flaw -hamartia - that leads them to make decisions that will eventually lead to their demise. Specifically, a hamartia is an internal flaw that a character is oblivious to and recognizes only once its too late, and the damage has already been done. Oedipus Rex, by Sophocles, and Macbeth, by William Shakespeare, are tragedies that feature characters whose hamartia leads them to make decisions that negatively impact their lives. Both texts focus on characters facing a hard decision, with outside forces giving them advice on what to do. These external opinions conflict with the characters own internal instinct, forcing them to decide whether or not they will listen to the guidance of others. The plays Macbeth and Oedipus Rex offer lessons, albeit contradictory ones, on how one can make decisions, and know if that choice is right or wrong. 
Sophocles uses his play, Oedipus Rex, to provide a warning against ignoring those who know better. Oedipus is a king who unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother, Jocasta, setting a plague upon the city of Thebes. Oblivious to the fact that he is the cause of Thebes curse, Oedipus is determined to capture the culprit scourging the city and attempts to gain information from Tiresias, a seer blessed with divination. Tiresias, a mouthpiece of Apollo, warns Oedipus to should stop searching for answers, lest he discovers that he is the criminal he vowed to deracinate. However, Oedipus refuses to listen and accuses Tiresias of treachery:
OEDIPUS. No, I can't say I grasped your meaning.
       Out with it, again! 
TIRESIAS. I say you are the murderer you hunt. 
OEDIPUS. That obscenity, twiceby god, you'll pay. (Sophocles 180)
Oedipus is confused by Tiresias veiled warnings and demands the seer repeat himself. Yet, when Tiresias does, Oedipus gets angry and shouts threats, refusing to believe that he himself could be cursing Thebes. Tiresias acts as a mouthpiece for the gods, a greater power in the lives of ancient Greeks, and when Oedipus refuses to listen to or believe Tiresias words, he is scorning the words of the gods as well, implying he knows better than those with omniscient powers. This shows how Oedipus fatal flaw is hubris, an excess of pride, as this is what fuels him to reject the opinions of other, wiser, people. When Oedipus and Jocasta discover the truth, she kills herself, and Oedipus himself gorges his eyes out, making his previously metaphorical blindness literal. Oedipus realizes that his hubris blinded him to the possibility that he was responsible for cursing Thebes. He ends the play in shame and misery and realizes that those who warned him were not out to get him, but rather were attempting to help him. While external forces attempt to convince Oedipus that he might be wrong, his internal pride didnt allow him to listen. Oedipus Rex shows readers that if wiser or greater people are questioning ones actions, perhaps one should listen. 
Similarly, Jocasta, Oedipus mom and, later, wife, offers a lesson about hubris, and the dangers of overconfidence. When Oedipus is a baby, Jocasta receives the prophecy that he is destined to kill his father and then marry her, his mother. In an attempt to avoid this fate, she sends him away to be killed by a shepherd. However, this shepherd takes pity on Oedipus and sends him to live with King Polybus and Queen Merope in a different city. When Oedipus later receives this same prophecy, he runs away from the King and Queen, unaware that he is adopted and they are not his biological parents. On his journey back to Thebes, he kills his true father and, upon his return, marries Jocasta. Jocasta does not suspect that Oedipus could be her son, as she fully believes she had him killed. Jocastas fatal flaw is not her decision to have Oedipus killed, but rather her hidebound certainty that this choice allowed her to escape her fate. She later tells Oedipus; ...nothing human can penetrate the future. Here is proof, quick and to the point, and explains how she avoided her own prophecy. There, you see? Apollo brought neither thing to pass (Sophocles, 201). She dismisses the word of Apollo as merely chimerical and tells Oedipus to do the same, believing that she was able to outwit the gods. Her hubris blinds her to the possibility that her son could still be alive, and that the prophecy is true. When she finally discovers that Oedipus is, in fact, alive and married to her, she commits suicide. Jocastas character warns us, the readers, not to be overconfident in our actions, as an abundance of pride can blind us to other errors. In Oedipus Rex, Sophocles proposes not only that we should listen to the advice of others, and also suggests that we should never be overly confident in our own decisions. 
Shakespeares Macbeth provides a contradictory lesson, showing how ones own conscience can be the best indicator of right and wrong. Macbeth gets a prophecy from three witches who apprise him that he is to be king, despite the fact that King Duncan is still living. Unsure of what this prophecy could mean, Macbeth confides in his wife who convinces him to kill Duncan and ascend to power. While Lady Macbeth is confident in this decision, Macbeth himself is torn between his ambition and his loyalty to the crown. He speaks to Lady Macbeth, stating; We will proceed no further in this business: He hath honour'd me of late (Shakespeare, 41). Macbeth refuses to continue plotting Duncans assassination, recalling how kind the king has been. Macbeths conscience, his internal sense, is telling him that committing regicide is wrong, yet Lady Macbeths ribald persuasion eventually convinces him to carry out the murder. However, after killing King Duncan, Macbeth panics and hallucinates voices:
 Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!.../'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor/Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more/I'll go no more/I am afraid to think what I have done/Look on't again I dare not. (Shakespeare, 57)  
Macbeth claims he heard disembodied voices in Duncans chamber, telling him that he will sleep no more. Macbeth feels shame and fear over his actions, demonstrated by his refusal to return to Duncans room. As the play progresses, Macbeths guilt over all his actions accumulates, leading him to insanity. He is haunted by the ghost of his friend Banquo (whom he had killed), whose spirit appears covered in blood. This ghost, as well as the disembodied voices, act as literal manifestations of Macbeths growing guilt. He cannot rest easy, as he is literally chased by the memories of those he murdered. The presence of Macbeths guilt implies he feels a discrepancy between what he believes to be morally right and his actions. If he had ignored Lady Macbeths persuasion and listened to his conscience, he would have never started down the path of shame. This shows how one of the lessons of Macbeth is to trust ones internal instinct, and not to succumb to the pressure of the ambitions of others. 
Oedipus Rex and Macbeth provide audiences guidance when determining the right decisions from the wrong ones. As tragedies, these two plays demonstrate fatal mistakes, offering a lesson on how we can avoid similar errors. Oedipus Rex advises that we should listen to those who hold more power or knowledge, as our own perception can be obfuscated by personal faults. On the other hand, Macbeth recommends that we should trust our own instinct, and not be influenced by the possibly-biased views of others. While these lessons are presented in the context of gods and witches, we should consider the advice through a broader lens. After all, usually, witches will not prophesize what we should eat for dinner, nor will Apollo ask a student to explain why they know what they know. Still, dissecting these characters from a psychological standpoint preserves their value. While an average person may not worship Greek gods (or their mouthpieces), these deities can represent a figure that is wiser and holds more authority, perhaps a parent, teacher, or other pundit. Oedipus Rex suggests that these people are to be listened to, as they likely know better than us. Alternatively, Shakespeare suggests that internal conscience is the best indicator of judgment. While not all of us have an evil wife whispering in our ear, we may be surrounded by others whose opinions contradict personal beliefs. This appears in Genesis when Eve convinces Adam to eat the fruit, despite Gods warnings. Macbeth would advise Adam to trust his instinct and refuse Eves temptation. In the end, it is up to us to decide what advice we should follow; to decide which text will help us deduce what is right and wrong. Hopefully, we chose correctly, and avoid becoming yet another tragic hero.

Ocultando a la Vista: Temas Homosexuales en Los Sontes Del Amor Oscuro 
A pesar de Federico Garca Lorca es famoso para sus obras influyentes del mundo de arte, algunos de sus poemas del amor ms profundos permancan secreto hasta mucho despues de su muerte en 1936. Las Sonetos de Amor Oscuro eran guardado por un amigo ntimo de Lorca, Vicente Aleixandre, y los hijos de Aleixandre hasta fueron publicado finalmente por ABC en 1984. Estas poemas encierran la identidad gay secreta de Lorca, y dan ms conocimiento a sus emociones; sus penas y alegras de la vida que tena que ocultar. Cuando Lorca escribi los sonetos - durante un fin de semana en un hotel en Valencia - el pas fue un medioambiente de divergencia y tensin politicl, con la guerra civil espaola comenziendo en los aos prximos. La clima permiti para violencia nacional y era muy peligroso especialmente para los homosexuales. Federico Franco, el lder del los fuerzas nacionalistas fascistas y, finalmente, el dictador de espaa, propagaba mensajes de homofobia entre de su partido. Era imposible para Lorca a expresar su homosexualidad pblicamente sin arriesgando muerte. Aun as, sus obras homoroticos combinaron con sus acciones y escritos a apoyo de los republicanos (el partido opuesto del Franco) haca Lorca un blanco, y fue asesinado por los nacionalistas en agusto de 1936. Sin embargo, mitad de un dcada despues de su assasinacin, las Sonetos de Amor Oscuro, un tributo de su identidad, fue mostrado al mundo. Este ensayo enforcara en dos de las poemas; El Soneto de Dulce Queja y El Poeta Habla Por Telfono Con el Amor. Mientras de las obras de Lorca son conocidos para su vaguedad y smbolos con capas, analizando los sonetos puede darnos un conocimiento mejor de las temas de sexualidad. En Los Sonetos de Amor Oscuro, Lorca usa criaturas como metforas para su homosexualidad.  
Un motivo que aparece en las obras de Lorca es la naturaleza, especificamente criaturas, como un metfora para homosexualidad. En el soneto La Poeta Habla Por Telefono Con El Amor el verso final describe el voz del amor;
Lejana como oscura corza herida.
Dulce como un sollozo en la nevada.
Lejana y dulce en tutano metida!
El uso de la corza en este contexto seala un simbolo para los sentimientos contrastes de Lorca sobre su sexualidad. La corza, un tipo de ciervo, tiene una connotacin bblica sobre reticencia de temptacin y deseos sexuales. Yo os conjuro, oh doncellas de Jerusaln, por los corzos y por las ciervas del campo, que no despertis ni hagis velar al amor hasta que quiera. (La Biblia de Reina Valera Gmez).  Este pasaje significa control, diciendo las hijas a no participan en actos sexuales hasta el tiempo es correcto (pressunamente hasta son casados). Sin embargo, en el soneto, Lorca escribe que la corza tiene una herida. Es posible que este se refiera que el no poda controllar su deseo, o el facto que la relacin es entre de dos hombres. Usando juztapositin, entre el simbulo de la Biblia (con catolicismo siendo una creenicia clave de las nacionalistas) y las temas homosexuales, Lorca ilustra un medioabiente de polarizacin, interno y externo, de su vida. En El Soneto de La Dulce Queja, Lorca comienza la poema con el miedo de perdiendo su amante. El sonto describe un relacin txico. La lnea Si t eres el tesoro oculto mo, / si eres mi cruz y mi dolor mojado monstra un patrn de sufrimiento para su amor y, como Jess, sacrifiendo un mismo para una causa. Este da contexto para un otro ejemplo de la naturaleza. La frase de noche me pone en la mejilla / la solitaria rosa de tu aliento se puede leer como un simbolo romantico, como el sonrojo de amor. Sin embargo, la palabra solitarlia tiene un otro significado tambin, que una tena. Si rosa esta describiendo solitaria (en lugar del otro manera alrededor), este crea un significado doble de la poema. En adicin, un verso despus menciona para el gusano de mi sufrimiento. Una solitaria se comporta como un simbolo para una influencia que est doliendo Lorca. La solitaria se alimenta de la poeta, robando el sustento que l necesita a sobrevivir, como el secreto de homosexualidad resta sus abilidades a amor. Como la corza, Lorca usa la solitaria como un smbolo enmascarado de su identidad gay. 
A primera vista estes poemas, Lorca aparece a incluye criaturas casi al azar. Mucho de los sonetos son empastados con referencias a la sexualidad de Lorca, que no expresaba explcitamente. En retrospectiva, conociendo la vida de Lorca, es ms facil a identifica simbolos sobre su homosexualidad. Sin embargo, en el tiempo, Lorca tena cuidado a aludir a la solomente con metfora, porque el significado puede cambiar a basa de el lector. Usando estes simbolos, Lorca poda expresear su amor imesno y pena profunda sin revelando su identidad 	autntica.

Plato: What is the ideal education system?
Amelia: In order to answer that question, we first must ask, What is the fundamental nature of humankind? How can we begin to determine what to teach students if we dont first understand what innate qualities students have? 
Plato: I agree. Indeed that question must first be answered.
Amelia: Well then, the first question we must consider in our efforts to understand the nature of humankind is whether humans are born with inherent talents in certain subjects. 
Plato: I believe that no two people are born exactly alike. There are innate differences which fit them for different occupations (Platos Republic Book II, 56). 
Amelia: I must agree. For example, if people were not born with innate aptitudes, how could one explain prodigies? How could one explain why siblings (who grow up receiving the same education and experiences) struggle and excel in different disciplines? 
Plato: Exactly. 
Amelia: And now having established that people are born with such natural talents, would you agree that an efficient and well-functioning society would take advantage of these innate aptitudes by placing people in jobs they are best suited for? 
Plato: Yes, society would advance if jobs are filled with the people best suited for them. 
Amelia: So then one goal for education should be to identify students innate aptitudes and lead them down paths that will help further develop their talents and prepare them for careers that utilize their talents. 
Plato: Yes. Now can we begin to devise a system that achieves this goal?
Amelia: Not yet. In addition to determining whether humans have natural talents for certain subjects, we must also ask whether humans are instinctually good citizens.
Plato: How do you define a good citizen?  
Amelia: A good citizen is one who actively contributes to the function and advancement of society. In order to contribute in such a way, one must be capable of critical thinking and questioning and must aim to advance society rather than solely their self-interest. 
Plato: I believe that humans are not naturally born with such skills. Rather, I think we are inherently more concerned with ourselves than with others and we naturally depend on others to form our opinions. As Bloom says about the nature of mankind in a democracy, In the absence of anything else to which to turn, the common beliefs of most men are almost always what will determine judgment (Bloom, 247). 
Amelia: Exactly. Ironically, even under a democratic government, which in and of itself encourages independent thinking, people still search for an authority figure to feed them their thoughts. This demonstrates that independent thinking is not ingrained in human nature and thus conveys the importance of teaching people to think critically.
Plato: I agree. However, before we continue, let me make sure I understand what we have discussed. We have established that education is meant to achieve two goals. First, education should aim to produce citizens capable of critical thinking and selflessness. Second, education should aim to identify innate talents and lead students to exercise those talents in career paths best suited to their natures.  
Amelia: Yes. 
Plato: How can such goals be achieved?
Amelia: Let's first begin with primary and secondary education. All primary and secondary education institutions will have a standardized liberal arts curriculum focused on developing students abilities to think independently. 
Plato: How will a liberal arts education achieve this goal? 
Amelia: A liberal arts education provides students with foundational knowledge in an array of subjects. Such education is necessary for students to formulate their own worldviews and opinions. 
Plato: Indeed, if one does not understand how the world functions, one does not have any structure with which to critique or agree.
Amelia: Yes. In this way, a liberal arts education is compatible with teaching the Socratic method and other methods of critical thinking. In primary and secondary school, the liberal arts curriculum will promote the understanding of different subjects in conjunction with the questioning of such subjects. 
Plato: You also mentioned that education should teach people to think about society rather than just their own self-interests. Does a liberal arts education also promote this type of thinking? 
Amelia: While a liberal arts education does not have a monopoly over encouraging this type of thinking, it is still an effective way to teach sentiments of anti-egoism because it forces all students to interact with literature. Literature tends to convey values more powerfully because it brings people into a story and lets them experience and feel the value of a particular principle. 
Plato: What about the Principle of Specialization? A liberal arts education certainly does not divide or sort students' educational studies based on their innate aptitudes. In fact, it does the opposite. 
Amelia: Not quite so fast. I did not say that a liberal arts education would extend into university. Liberal arts education in primary and secondary school will expose students to different subjects. By the conclusion of secondary school, students understandings of each subject will have reached an advanced enough level for interests and talents to be identified. After students potentials in each subject are identified, liberal arts will no longer be the basis for school curriculums. 
Plato: What is the problem with teaching a liberal arts curriculum in universities?
Amelia: Few people are adept in multiple fields. 
Plato: A man does better keeping to one trade than working at many trades (Plato, 57).
Amelia. Indeed. Therefore, a liberal arts education at the university level does not prepare most people for a career. Students finish their education without specialization in any one subject. The socio-economic elite can then attend graduate school where they are prepared for a career in a single field. However, others are left in debt without their potential fully being reached and without the credentials necessary to work in an advanced field. 
Plato: So what will replace the liberal arts education? 
Amelia: Each university will be devoted to a particular field of study. There will be an entrance exam for each university that serves as an aptitude test. This means that only people capable of pursuing a career in that field will be admitted to the university. 
Plato: Will aptitude tests vary in difficulty depending on the university? 
Amelia: No. All universities focused on the same subject will have the same aptitude test. This means that the selectiveness of the university one attends will not play a role in determining ones career path. In other words, students aptitude test scores collected directly after secondary school when they have not yet immersed themselves in the study of their subject will not determine their capabilities for specific jobs within a field. 
Plato: Then how will the very adept be distinguished from just the adept? How will we determine who is fit for the most advanced jobs in society?
Amelia: The first two years at university will be spent focused on developing everyones understanding of a certain topic. Then, based on ones performance over the first two years, students will be divided into two sections. The first section, composed of students that performed in the bottom 70-80%,  will follow a pre-professional course for the rest of university. This course will prepare students for specific jobs so they may begin work directly after graduating from university. The second section composed of students who performed in the top 20-30% of the class will continue deepening their understanding of the subjects. Only the latter section of students qualify for graduate school which will prepare them for careers in more academically demanding fields. 
Plato: But what about people who are adept at and interested in multiple subjects? 
Amelia: Again, few people are adept at multiple subjects and want to pursue an interdisciplinary field that requires advanced knowledge in multiple disciplines. However, for such people, there will be a small number of liberal arts universities that allow students to study at an advanced level in multiple disciplines. Only those that are best at critical thinking will be permitted to attend such institutions. 
Plato: Indeed, this education system seems to be fitting for a society that values the principle of specialization and independent, selfless thinking.
 
The Wretched of the Earth & the Blessed of the Heavens: Oppression as Psychological Violence
The dogma of oppression always draws clear lines in the sand. It always takes great care to erect a fortress for the systems beneficiaries, one thats impenetrable to those who do not enjoy a privileged status. The message is clear: there is a place for the superior and there is a place for the inferior; this order is not to be disrupted. To prevent illicit crossing, officers of the regime police the border, with their vital organs protected and their weapons at the ready. This concept, of two parallel societies, is an eternal one. Saint Augustine, in 426 AD, disseminated his vision of two cities: the City of God: of the heavens, and the City of Man: of the earth. The former is a paradise, beatified by the love of and for God, and the latter is a sinful, degenerate ghetto resultant of mans love for himself and for pleasure. Augustines border agents, in this case, are members of the church, who declare adamantly that passage into paradise is impossible to achieve on Earth, and that true contentment can be found only in the afterlife. The City of God is a city of immovable ideals, a perfect, static image of harmony. It is the model by which we should fashion our lives, the touchstone by which we should measure our behavior. But it is never to be entered by man on Earth, for such a transgression disrupts the order of duality upon which the ideology depends. It is eternal, and we are fleeting. This duality is mirrored by every power structure that seeks to permeate the psyches of the oppressed to safeguard itself from overthrow. Those in power fashion an image of themselves that imitates divinity and ascribes to themselves the characteristics of walking Gods, and in doing so impress upon the oppressed populations the notion of an impassable divide.
Frantz Fanon, Algerian revolutionary and radical political thinker, like Augustine, introduces us to a set of twin cities: the respective sectors of the colonists and colonized. As with the cities of God and man, these two sectors are wholly exclusive. Like the City of God, [t]he
colonist's sector is a sector built to last, all stone and steel, and, like the City of Man,  is a disreputable place inhabited by disreputable people.1 Simone de Beauvoir, in her seminal feminist work The Second Sex, finds another similar duality, that of  the Subject, [...] the Absolute and the Other.2 She speaks, of course, of the divide between Man and Woman. Like colonialism, the patriarchy clearly designates two places: a mans place, that is, personhood itself, and a womans place, a secondary existence that is defined in relation to the universal Man. Subversion of these roles, attempted movement from place to place, is met with intimidation and force. But the violence of oppression, spoken of so often in revolutionary works, constitutes not just the physical but also the temporal, because the division itself is an act of psychological violence. The delegation of a certain group to subservience and squalor degrades a person in the basest manner. Its a degradation that permeates the soul. Fanon himself was a psychologist, who saw firsthand the mental havoc that French colonialism had wreaked on his patients. He describes this as a sort of muscular tension:
In the colonial world, the colonized's affectivity is kept on edge like a running sore flinching from a caustic agent. And the psyche retracts, is obliterated, and finds an outlet through muscular spasms that have caused many an expert to classify the colonized as hysterical.3
Here we come to a particularly important truth, that continual subjugation brews anger and despair. These emotions, often unconsciously, are channeled away from the guilty parties and toward the victims themselves. This is manifest in psychosis and suicidality among oppressed groups, who see no way out, and so retreat inward. As Fanon points out, these actions are weaponized as evidence of a groups mental inferiority, and so of the justice and naturalness
1 Fanon 4
2 Beauvoir
3 Fanon 19
of their oppression. The phenomenon of female hysteria is particularly well-documented, being a point of extreme fascination for psychoanalysts, and also for the general public. Of these
female-hysterics, french feminist Catherine Clment, in her 1975 essay The Guilty One, says the following:
These women, to escape the misfortune of their economic and familial exploitation, chose to suffer spectacularly before an audience of men: it is an attack of spectacle, a crisis of suffering. And the attack is also a festival, a celebration of their guilt used as a weapon, a story of seduction. All that, within the family.4
What Clment points to here is that women are ingratiated with men through the familial structure. Thus, for them, muscular spasms are but another act of performance in the theater of their own oppression. The voyeuristic consumption of female suffering is omnipresent, it is the glass wall that drives through a home, separating a mans place from a womans place. Likewise, the desperate cries of the colonized are used as a marker between civilized and uncivilized, between human and subhuman. Even the oppressed subjects battered psyche is leveraged against them by their oppressors.
In the realms of mysticism and magic, we find another outlet for the angst of a disempowered population. Fanon refers to voodoo and dance as examples of this, during which the most brutal aggressiveness and impulsive violence are channeled, transformed, and spirited away.5 So too does religion and superstition rise, wherein new, familiar evils are invented so as to distract from the real, and more unwieldy evil of colonialism. Among women, we see a similar, though slightly different move toward the supernatural. Many women find themselves comforted by the concept of a divine feminine. Women feel themselves at one with their

5 Fanon 19
purpose and in control of their sexuality and lives by virtue of their acknowledgment and embrace of some sort of preordained, feminine purpose. A woman commodifies herself to avoid facing the terrifying reality of her situation  in Beauvoirs words, she succumbs to the temptation to forgo liberty and become a thing.6 This thing, a divine woman, is, in equal measure as the superstition of African nations that Fanon describes, a fiction. But fiction is comforting, Fanon affirms.
In scaring me, the atmosphere of myths and magic operates like an undeniable reality. In terrifying me, it incorporates me into the traditions and history of my land and ethnic group, but at the same time I am reassured and granted a civil status, an identification. [...] Zombies, believe me, are more terrifying than colonists. And the problem now is not whether to fall in line with the armor-plated world of colonialism, but to think twice before urinating, spitting, or going out in the dark.7
These practices are not subversive, they are outlets, side roads for frustrations that cannot be fully realized without the complete disruption of the social fabric that produced them. Liberation necessitates the shedding of these fictions, say Fanon and Beauvoir. The retributive violence among the people needs to be redirected away from the emotional outlet of myth, toward the perpetrators themselves. This is the only path toward freedom. The only way out is through. As for the remnants of these invented identities, there is no place for them after and during the revolutionary period. After all, says Fanon, [w]ith his back to the wall, the knife at his throat, or to be more exact the electrode on his genitals, the colonized subject is bound to stop telling stories.8 But the issue is perhaps not so easily resolved. How can one turn to their
self-proclaimed comrades, their brothers in arms, and tell them that the very basis of their
6 Beauvoir
7 Fanon 19
8 Fanon 20
identities must be destroyed? Can you truly tell someone their traditions, their only reprieve, are weapons of their own oppression? Is it fair to ask someone, to ask yourself, to eradicate the only thing that has kept you sane?
When we strip ourselves of the comfortable fictions we shroud ourselves in, we are made to face the abyss before us. According to Sartre, it is only within this abyss that we can find freedom, [f]or if indeed existence precedes essence, one will never be able to explain ones action by reference to a given and specific human nature; in other words, there is no determinism  man is free, man is freedom.9If existence precedes essence, personhood precedes womanhood, and so too does it precede the racial and economic categories we, both oppressed and oppressors, use to define ourselves. This is an uncomfortable reality. The act of revolution is then to ceaselessly and violently seek equality for a group, only to realize that that group doesnt exist. It is not just the mystical tenants of voodoo or divine feminine sexuality that are false, but all categorization. There were no natives before there were foreign invaders. Similarly, there were no women before there was the universal Man. Simone de Beauvoir grapples with this fact: What is a woman?10 she asks, what is she if not not man? The truth is that the only reality is the physical reality of oppression. In the words of Fanon, the only truth is what hastens the dislocation of the [...] regime. Within oppressive structures, there is no truthful behavior. And good is quite simply what hurts [the oppressors] most.11 The psychological damage inflicted by oppression is so pervasive that it continues to permeate identity formation for as long as we allow it to. It tells us who we are, what we are, where we come from, and where were going.
The mechanisms we devise to cope with this, too, are constrictive fictions based on the canon that has been forcefully instilled in us. As in Sartre, in order to free ourselves from these
9 Sartre
10 Beauvoir
11 Fanon 14
temporal chains, it is imperative that we recognize our existence is defined only by our freedom, and nothing else. Hence, the struggle for liberation necessitates an internal revolution of identity, one that is just as violent as a physical revolution. In fact, the overthrow of an oppressive structure is not just violent but nauseating. It is stomach-turning, uncomfortable, abject, and disgusting to discover that what you have been taught, what you have embraced and found comfort in, what has cut you open and bled you dry, is a complete and utter fiction. What is even more disconcerting is to realize you dont know who you are without it. Revolution is terrifying. It rips the ground from beneath you: it bulldozes the City of Man, burns the Sector of the Colonized to the ground, and flattens a Womans Place. It makes the world empty: empty of all the voices that once told you everything about who you were. But in that emptiness is freedom, and only when we embrace that uncertain and unnerving darkness do we find that we are finally liberated.

The United States is a country that is filled with turmoil, a country with two sides of an argument that neither two can fully ever agree on. It is for this reason that we see constant issues where someone is always not happy with a decision, sometimes even coming to violence, extreme instances of protesting, and vandalization just to prove that point. America being a two party democracy, this is one of its flaws on its own, but working with what we have These problems have a solution, one which can be solved through two simple theories. Uniting people under one issue, and appealing to what both parties want, even with your own agenda.
If we are to assume you do not plan on changing your inferior ways of a democracy to a great republic, the first  step to doing that is uniting people under one issue. A prince, or in this case a president needs control over his people, but that cannot be done when two parties represent two sides to many issues. The same can be said with presidents, its idiotic having a president have a label on him that represents a party that is conflicted with half of the population. This is why a president needs to unite everyone over a common issue, and then silence the people that still disagree with you by alienating them from the public. I judge those princes capable of standing on their own who have an abundance of men or of money, so that they can put together a sufficient army and fight a battle in the field against anyone who comes to attack them.  This issue can be so much as an enemy, to which you can show with your military power that you, and you alone can lead everyone to certain victory, thus giving everyone a reason to root for you, for it's because of you only that you stomped this enemy down that threatened your nation. It's important to note that this enemy does not have to exist too, there can be fabricated attacks from a made up group in a foreign country. While there will still be strife between the two parties for their own inconsequential problems, you will still have the comfort knowing both parties support you in totality, because at the end of the day nothing matters then your own image and position in state.
This leads me into my second point, appealing to both parties to further your trust with the people in your nation. In order to keep people from rebelling, and minimizing the amount of conspirators in your country, deal with hot topic issues present in the country that are causing strife. Take crime rates and deaths for example, the way in which it is dealt with is a constant issue of turmoil between people of different parties, and to minimize that it will take some steps. Briefly make this issue seemingly your top priority, patrol both rich and poor neighborhoods equally so the people feel there is no discrimination. Secondly, instate fear through force. If people see police constantly patrolling the streets, the likelihood of rebellion decreases because to them you aren't trying to intimidate everyone, youre helping the crime rate go down. This is a simple matter of masking your actual goal. You will be inciting fear, but its hidden behind this original goal you said you would deal with. a wise prince (president) should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavor only to avoid hatred, as is noted. They cannot hate you if you are solving the very issue they complained about. However in this world, there will always be conspirators. The fact that you are doing everything to help these issues there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him. You will have the trust of the people and those around you, so these conspirators can simply be alienated from the rest.
The road to a successful two party democracy is a rough one, as these parties only get us further from unity by having specific ideals behind each party that are unique to the two. That is why as a ruler it takes someone who is willing to use fear over issues to unite the two, by finding at least one instance of common ground. As long as both parties think you are doing something right, you are doing the right thing as a leader and will absolutely maintain power, because while they are having their strife in the background, they all have some security in that you, regardless of believes, are protecting this great nation. 
Your Royal Highness Queen Mary, 
    Firstly, I would like to state that, while you are under no obligation to give this letter a second glance, I hope to offer up some of the vast knowledge Ive collected about one ruling a kingdom and, subsequently, how one should act when they have risen to power. If youd be so accepting of my words, I hope to both commend your rule as well as share some critiques. If you wish to hear them, they are as follows, in chronological order of your life;
1.I commend your ability to overcome your father, King Henry VIIIs, claim of your illegitimacy, and seize the throne despite said obstruction. 
While, as I point out in my writing, The Prince, hereditary states are easier to hold (for citizens are more agreeable to families that have always held power), your position is unique as your Catholic views differ greatly from those of your forefathers, which puts you in no better a position than a new, non-hereditary, ruler. To make matters worse, your birth was ruled illegitimate by King Henry VIII, challenging your ability to inherit the throne after your cousins death. Yet, by the will of the English citizens, you were chosen to succeed King Edwards and seized the throne from the newly-crowned Lady Jane Gray. Your ability to, initially, gain so much popularity amongst the common people points only to your success in leading up to this point, for, while you were at odds with the monarchy, you had the public on your side. 
2.In relation to this last point, I commend your choice to hide your Catholic views from the people. 
Your rise to power at the will of the people would have been near impossible had they, a majority Protestant society, known of your devout Popish beliefs. Your decision to hide your religion allowed you to infiltrate both their hearts and, consequently, their castle when you revealed your true intentions, which we shall address later. As a monarch, it is of the utmost importance to appear a certain way, even if your true nature is the opposite. One should [1]appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite. Ones outward appearance and behavior are crucial in gaining popularity amongst the common people, and ones true intentions, seeing if theyre against the will of the people, should be hidden.
3.If I may offer criticism of the persecution and execution of Protestant heretics throughout your rule. 
This issue of persecution is a difficult one to face as a ruler, as the killings themselves are not the issue, but rather the way one goes about it. [2]A ruler ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated. However, your killings of Englands Protestants led your citizens to hate you and view you as nothing less than a tyrant. A ruler should never be viewed as a tyrant, for when your own people have turned against you it makes it that much easier for outside enemies to plant seeds of rebellion. As a general rule, [3]rulers ought to, in the first place, avoid being hated by everyone, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavor with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Yet, you started your rule as a scorned daughter in religious disagreement with your fathers before you. Given these circumstances, you only had the people on your side, yet you turned them against you. To avoid this hatred, you had, as I see it, two choices. The first is to truly attempt to annihilate all devotees of the Protestant religion throughout England, killing each and every one. While this would be a huge undertaking, it would have allowed you to start the country anew with a Catholic religious majority. The killing of some, but not all, Protestants allowed for the horror of your actions to spread until even those religiously aligned with you could not help but acknowledge your cruelty. Therefore, the other option, which I believe to be preferable, is to continue your guise of Protestantism, and slowly integrate Catholicism into your people and society. This choice allows for less hatred among the people, allowing room for certain cruelty when it is truly necessary. [4]A ruler, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty, yet you allowed religion to divide your country, and therefore any cruelty on your part would be against your advantage. In my opinion, your biggest mistake as a monarch was that you allowed your piety to become stronger than your will for a united country. 
With this advice, I hope you can now better reflect on your time as queen. 
Long Live Your Majesty,
         				 Machiavelli

Your country 
Dear Kim Jong-un:
	I see cracks in the seemingly unshakable state of your rule over the nation of North Korea. For decades, your family has maintained absolute power within the empire in which you reside. Despite the severe opposition of many major world superpowers, including the neighboring country, your hereditary rule over your subjects has proved impenetrable. By integrating your government and military into everything that happens within your borders, you have eliminated any possibility of thinking or actions that contrast with what you want. But despite the appearance of perfection, your recent actions reveal a flaw in your plan, a subtle note of instability that, if left unchecked, threatens the integrity of your leadership. If you wish to maintain supreme power, you must be extremely careful not to act in unnecessary ways that cause hatred toward yourself and threaten to destabilize the foundation upon which your rule is built. 
	Before we discuss your flaws, it is necessary to examine the profound and lasting success of your rule. Since North Koreas establishment, the security and obedience of your nation have not wavered. You have embraced Machiavellis principles by maintaining a government that snuffs out any chance of revolution through a formidable military. By building a society controlled and dictated entirely by you, your citizens remain compliant because they are taught to adore North Korea and fear every other nation. Through periodic shows of military power and unwavering enforcement of laws that restrict anything that does not fit your needs, you have ensured that the people fear you. In the sense that it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with, (Machiavelli chapter 17), your citizens both fear and love you because of the military society you maintain. Your ability to maintain the appearance of being a perfect and caring ruler while using the military to be feared has enabled your regime to remain supreme, thus creating a solid foundation upon which your power stands.
	That said, you have become sloppy in the ways that you exert your military power to dispel opposition. Supreme leaders such as yourself must indeed eliminate those that pose a threat to their leadership; these actions are beneficial when they are applied at one blow and are necessary to ones security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects (Machiavelli chapter 8). You have repeatedly violated this rule in recent years, opting for glamorous shows of power that are counterproductive to maintaining your reputation. For example, the murders of prominent members of your family were unnecessary and dangerous. In executing your brother in a different country, you greatly increased international criticism and hatred towards your rule, increasing the threat of outside attack and decreasing the chance of economic interaction. By having dogs brutally eat your uncle alive, you directly attacked the idea that your family is sacred, perfect, and happy. You must remember that when it is necessary for [a ruler] to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause (Machiavelli chapter 17). But the most dangerous habit of all is your repeated and regular nuclear threats to nations across the world. Although these do help reinforce the image of power among your citizens, the frequent nature of the threats causes the rest of the world to fear you less and makes it certain that your empire can never have a chance of expanding, trading, or interacting with anyone outside the borders of North Korea. The actions and killings described above are not only unnecessary but risk destroying the illusion of greatness that your citizens see and increasing the risk of invasion or suppression by other nations.
	If you, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, wish to ensure the continued power and control of the Kim Dynasty, you must be extremely vigilant not to act in ways that risk shattering the intricate illusion of prosperity that you have built around your country. For decades, your family has enjoyed total control over the people of North Korea, reaping the benefits derived from an obedient population. You have achieved said obedience through the brute force method of force, propaganda, and fear; all of which have resulted in a successful Machiavellian hereditary principality. However, there is one fundamental problem with your rule: you have forgotten that it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory (Machiavelli chapter 8). I am writing this letter to warn you: your supreme rule may be nothing but a massive, highly armed glass onion that risks being peeled back and shattered by your erratic and risky behavior.
Outline: 
1.Body 2: Recent dangerous actions
a.Killing of family, silencing/killing of powerful subjects
i.See where its coming from, but ____
b.Committed actions all at once or no?
2.Body 3: Appearance of success is false
a.Though you may maintain relative peace and compliance through military, your empire is an illusion.
b.Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory.
c.Show of military power and fake unity prevent invasion, but in reality empire is all but stagnant. Majority of citizens live in miserable living conditions. Uprising prevented only through complete deprivation of any non-state sanctioned information. 
d.Missile tests and closed off country ensure that nearby superpowers will never cooperate with you: you are stuck in your country in terms of area, trade, economy and everything else. 
e.This all creates an illusion of success; echo chamber of need for glory hides teh fact that no glory exists. 
3.Conclusion
a.Restate thesis: impressive hold on empire, but illusion of glory hides potential for great disaster
b.Summarize success, failure
c.
Military success of keeping army of his own (not mercenaries) and fortifying to scare neighbors into compliance
When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man. Chapter 7
Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius. Chapter 8
Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this follows from severities[2] being badly or properly used. Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to ones security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.
[2] Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern equivalent of Machiavellis thought when he speaks of crudelta than the more obvious cruelties.
Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.
And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them. Chapter 8
Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with.  Chapter 17
Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. Chapter 17
Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite. Chapter 18
For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. Chapter 18

Special Re-print: On Crime by R. Raskolnikov
AN EXTRAORDINARY GLIMPSE INTO CRIME
BY RODION ROMANOVICH RASKOLNIKOV

Editor in Chief: Ashley Tong
the other hand, it is the obligation of extraordinary people to change the world, without regard to how many people they hurt, for their actions are for the betterment of the greater good.
As part of St. Petersburgs police force and an upstanding citizen, I simply cannot condone this abhorrent theory. I am a firm believer that ones intelligence does not need to be blared out from the rooftops. If someone is indeed of extraordinary cleverness,  they  should  utilize  their  inherent
We live in a world where our actions,
both big and small, undoubtedly touch and affect the lives of others for years to come. Sometimes, that comes in the form of a kind-hearted person rescuing a stranger, enabling or at least adding to the possibility of that strangers future generations existence. Other times, actions that modern society would consider as crimes are committed. Based on societal expectations and common law, these so-called crimes are cruel and unnecessary. However, when committed by the right person, these crimes are not as terrible as they seem. Thus we present the question of how to determine whether ones actions are justified, if the ends are of more importance than the means, and if consequences should be suffered.
There are two types of people in this world. Most people are born ordinary, live ordinary lives, and die simply to fade away and be forgotten. However, an unusually small number of people are born, even strangely few, with a new idea, or who are capable of even uttering something new (288). These are the extraordinary. They are revolutionaries, fighters, geniuses, and prodigies. They are men of genius
 out of millions, and great geniuses, the culmination of humanity  perhaps only as a result of the passing of many thousands of millions of people across the earth (289). For them, death does not represent the end, for they will live on in the words, minds, and hearts of others for years and decades to come. They are immortal in their actions and eternal in their conceptions. The extraordinary prevails while the ordinary withers away.
The extraordinary are those who have ideas to contribute to the world. They are those who have the potential to truly make a difference. And it is because of this potential that the extraordinary person may be allowed to undertake actions that an ordinary person cannot. These actions can range anything from robbery to murder, for sometimes, extraordinary people must overstep moral boundaries for the sake of the greater good. And if some blood must be spilt so that one may impact the world for the better, then such crimes are no longer crimes, but necessary and needed. Napoleon slaughtered millions. And yet, no one can deny that he was one of the greatest men to step foot on this earth. And if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could in no way have become known to people other than through the sacrifice of the lives of one, ten, a hundred, and so on, people who interfered with their discoveries or who were obstacles blocking their way, then Newton had the right, and was even obligated to eliminate those ten or a hundred people in order to make his discoveries known to all humanity (285). A brief peruse through history books will reveal that a majority of those benefactors and trailblazers of humanity were particularly horrible shredders of blood (185). In fact, it is improbable, and maybe even impossible, for an extraordinary person to exist without having perpetrated immoral actions, for it is the mark of an extraordinary person to break free from societal expectations and to carve a new path. By staying within the bounds of the rules, one is resigning themselves to ordinariness.
While the extraordinary are allowed and encouraged to commit crimes to further their respective missions, the ordinary cannot. This is because extraordinary people are able to see through their unethical deeds and concentrate on the end results.
The morality of what they are doing does not affect
them because extraordinariness powers the ability to ignore the conscience. This is not a talent that the ordinary possess; their sense of righteousness and virtue does not permit that, which is why for an ordinary person, the act of committing a crime is always accompanied by illness (284). Ordinary people are inherently born with a drive for obedience. Any breaking of the rules will weigh so heavily on an ordinary person that the guilt for what they have done will eat them up from the inside. In many cases, there is even no need to punish transgressions from an ordinary person because they will willingly inflict punishment on themselves, some even going as far as turning themselves in, for the knowledge and remorse of their undertakings registers so strongly and painfully within.
Though human nature is diverse, the two distinct classifications of extraordinary and ordinary will persist. No matter how many crimes are committed or how many seemingly revolutionary initiatives are undertaken, it is impossible for a person who was born ordinary to become extraordinary.

Police Detective Responds to Infamous Article
By Porfiry Petrovich
My Dear Readers,
I recently had the privilege of reading an article called On Crime in Periodical Discourses, written by a charming young law student in St. Petersburg: Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov. The articles main premise is that in society, there are those who are ordinary and those that are extraordinary. Ordinary people are to live a life of obedience in which they follow the law and stay away from anything unconventional. They are incapable of committing crimes without their moral conscience from torturing them afterwards. On
advantages for humanitarian efforts instead of exploiting it as a justification and excuse to perform moral atrocities. Though the article pushes that extraordinary people may need to commit crimes for the good of others, I urge Raskolnikov to picture our city of St. Petersburg when its citizens are running amok murdering each other for the sake of mutual benefit.
Regarding the writing of the article itself, I have in mind that greater accuracy is needed so to speak, more external distinctness (287). Omitted from the article is perhaps the most important question and answer required to make Raskolnikovs proposition even the slightest bit feasible: How do you know if someone is extraordinary? Im sure many people who have read Raskolnikovs article already fancy themselves to be among the extraordinary, for who among us in Holy Rus doesnt consider himself a Napoleon these days? (291-292). One cannot argue that it would be extremely difficult to differentiate between the true extraordinary and those who simply believe they are. Moreover, the article is written by someone who believes in this theory as if it has already been proven to be true. It seems to me that the author, Raskolnikov, believes that he himself is an extraordinary man uttering some new word (291).
As a police detective, I have aided in thousands of cases concerning a wide range of crimes and circumstances, which is why I believe Raskolnikovs theory of the extraordinary is fundamentally flawed because of one word: environment. The environment in which someone is raised can be the singular most defining factor to what sort of person they become. For example, in all my years of work, I have learned that a crime against a young girl can very, very often be explained by the environment (282). Similarly, it would be easy for someone to be extraordinary if their intellect was cultivated as a child and they left for adulthood with loving parents who would donate endless amounts of money and resources to make their childs far-fetched dreams come true. On the other hand, how could one dedicate time to taking those revolutionary initiatives that are the mark of an extraordinary person if theyre doing backbreaking work all day long just to provide for food, clothing, and a roof over their head?
Raskolnikovs article does not take into account lifes many factors that may determine if one is extraordinary or not. Moreover, it is, quite frankly, dangerous. It is horrifying how the article speaks to the sanctioning of bloodshed as a matter of conscience (289), and I absolutely condone that. You all should as well.

The Benefit of Communes
Breaking away from societal expectations
I once knew a young woman, a girl really, whose identity I shall conceal in this letter. Because of certain family circumstances, she, as the oldest child, was sent out onto the streets with a yellow card. Despite doing this for her family, the poor girl was not able to live with them anymore  their landlady wouldnt allow it  and she had to move out. She now continues working as a prostitute while sending the money to her family and living a secluded life in shame. But though she is scorned here, she will be respected and valued in my commune.1 That is the beautiful end waiting for the thousands more devastating souls like hers throughout St. Petersburg.
Life in a commune is without prejudice,
and there is no job too disgraceful or useless. Those in the commune do not judge based on imsy societal stereotypes, but instead, see everything and everyone as valuable in their own way. For those who feel as though their future has been restricted and chosen for them, please consider starting up a commune with me! I promise that your life will be free and wholeheartedly yours. There will no longer be any more arbitrary and meaningless rules and expectations to abide by.
I am searching for like-minded educated and progressive fellows like me, men or women, and together, we can create a haven for many. Please contact me if any of this sounds interesting to you and if you wish to take part.

Sofia Semyonovma Marmeladov posing for a picture at Semyon Marmeladovs funeral wake.
Former civil servants eldest child speaks out
My father, Semyon Zakharych Marmeladov, unfortunately passed away recently after a freak catastrophe on the streets of St. Petersburg. He had accidentally been run over by a horse-drawn carriage and lost a lot of blood. My dear father held on for as long as he could before he finally passed away at home, surrounded by friends and family.5
Those who interacted with him in the later stages of his life will describe him negatively as a drunk and a thief. Though it is true that due to the hardships of life, he turned to squandering money in the taverns, no one can deny the love he had for his family. My father leaves behind his wife, Katerina Ivanovna and my three younger siblings: Polina, Lenya, and Kolya.
Growing up, there was no money for me to go to school. Yet, my father tried his best to educate me and taught me a love for literature. Together, we learned about figures like the great Persian ruler, Cyrus the Great, and read texts such as Physiology of Everyday Life by George Lewes.6 Though he was sometimes not an honest and hardworking man, I know in my heart that he did not deserve the fate that was thrust upon him.
The one comfort I have right now is that God will forgive my fathers sins and he will live in eternal peace. Upon his deathbed, my father called out to me asking for my forgiveness and I gave it to him graciously. He repented his sins in front of a priest with remorse and offered himself to our merciful God. For that, I believe he is washed clean and can reside with our Almighty happy and content. This is the ultimate end and I wholeheartedly believe that my loving father has achieved it.

We stopped at the Persian king Cyrus the Great. Then, once she was older, she read some books of romantic content as well as several others, given to her by Mr. Lebezyatnikov.

On Crime
What is crime? Crime is a violation of the moral principles described by the legal system.
These moral principles serve to keep the people behaved and maintain societal stability. Mere stability, however, is not always what is most desirable; society is about moving forward and making progressnot idling in the same place.2 So, to truly advance society, the system meant to hold it in a stable place cannot be blindly followed. The legal system only serves to keep us in a rut. To break out of the rut, the law must be overstepped.3
Not everyone, though, has the right to overstep. This right is reserved to only the few who have the natural gift or talent of uttering a new word.4 We can call such people who are capable of contributing something new extraordinary while the rest are ordinary. Ordinary people are just that: ordinary. The only reason they exist is to reproduceas this is really the only thing they can ever achieve.5 Nearly all ordinary people cannot accept this reality, though, and believe that they are more than material meant for reproduction; they sincerely believe that they are extraordinary. One might ask then, If ordinary people imagine themselves as extraordinary, wouldnt they overstep as if they were extraordinary? Well, ordinary people can never do anything more than a few silly and relatively insignificant crimes so there is nothing to worry about.
You see, this is because ordinary people have an inborn inclination to obey. They are so well behaved that theyll punish each other and even themselves for the smallest infractions6 (crime will always result in illness7). These people will never get far because they are obligated to be obedientthats their destiny. On the other hand, extraordinary people are not so repelled by crimes that are considered sinful or collosal. They can overstep the law without thinking twice. Im not saying that extraordinary people have to commit outrages.8 All I am saying is that extraordinary individuals have the right to do what is necessary to allow them to realize their potential of advancing
humanity. If, for example, one, ten, a hundred, etc. people interfere with a new discovery or are obstacles, someone who is extraordinary has the right to remove them. If it is necessary to rob people to achieve a greater good, then an extraordinary person has the right to do so.9 Of course, what I have said is not anything new. This has all been written thousands of times by philosophers10 who range from the nihilists of ancient Greece to current philosophers like Nietzche. As they have all said, the superiority of extraordinary people gives them the right to overstep for the betterment of everyone.
This conclusion becomes even more self-evident when we examine history and some of humanitys greatest pioneers and trailblazers. Take Napoleon, for example, who (to name only a few of his significant contributions) implemented the Napoleonic Code, transformed the education system, and reimagined how cities were organized. In his career of reformation, he of course did not hesitate to kill (there is a reason he is known as one of the most brilliant military commanders in history). He caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers because he saw that this was necessary for the greater good.11 Like Napoleon, many of the Lycurguses, Solons, and Mohammeds of humanity (who, for the sake of conciseness, I will not examine very closely) were horrible shedders of blood, yet they also have many highly significant contributions.12 So, it seems that truly great individuals are obligated to overstep the law because this is what is necessary to achieve anything great.
With crime being necessary for the greater good, it can be difficult to judge our actions. How do we know if a crime benefits society and what is a just punishment? Conventional moral standards completely fail at this task, as they do not allow for any consideration of the nuance I have described above. In fact, moral judgements are quite irrational. Morals are not grounded in reason, they are simply feelings about what is right and wrong. Instead of irrational judging using morality, actions

should be judged by how effectively they achieve the end goal of advancing humanity.

The Fallacy of the Ordinary and Extraordinary
Two months ago, a little article in Periodical Discourses caught my eye (I believe, forgive me if I am not recalling it correctly, it was called On Crime).1 The main argument is that some people are inherently superior to others. Ordinary people are obligated to be obedient while extraordinary people can . . . well, not just that they can, but they are obligated to overstep the law and may kill as they wish (so that they can advance humanity). This idea, Ill admit, is clever, but it is not clever enough, you see. Just keep reading and Ill tell you the whole truth.
First, Ill invite you to consider religion. If extraordinary people have the right to commit all sorts of colossal outrages, it seems that they also have the right to commit any sin that they desire. They are convinced that it is okay and good to sin. I dont know of any religions that like it when people sinin fact, I get the impression that most religions are quite the opposite. How can extraordinary individuals possibly believe in New Jerusalem or God or the raising of Lazarus?2 The idea of extraordinary people is fundamentally at odds with religion. Lets forget religion for a moment, though, and consider all of the people of Holy Russia who think that they themselves arent ordinary, that is, they think that their purpose is not solely to reproduce. Who doesnt think they can utter some sort of new word and contribute something to humanity?3 It seems to me that this article has the capacity to inspire a great number of ordinary people to do terrible things.	It
is an invitation for vain people (and we all have some sort of vanity, just in varying degrees) to become criminals and siners.
Thats even more awful than an official or legal sanction for these immoral things!4 And Im not just saying that this new theory is

awful because of all the victims it will hurt.	The perpetrators
themselves would, in my opinion, suffer the most. Perpetrators who we would consider ordinary, using the logic of this article, will beat themselves up completely for any oversteplikely to the point of delirium and insanity. What could we possibly do to repare their conscience?5 All of Russias exiles, prisons, and hard labor wouldnt suffice. The many consciences this articles new theory will destroy will cause unbearable suffering to many people across Russia in addition to the victims themselves. What this all revealsI hope you now understandis that this silly little article is thoroughly wrong.
Now let me finish with something quite playful and psychological. When the author of this article (who I should probably not name) first conceived of this new theory, could he possibly have thought he was uttering a new word and was therefore extraordinary? Could it be the case that he has alreadyin the name of some greater goodcommitted some sort of atrocity, like perhaps killing a pawnbroaker with an axe?6

Private property is foundational to society. It has existed throughout virtually every civilization across humanity.
When I say private property, Im not talking about land ownership or some kind of legal agreement. Im talking about property in its most primitive and natural form which is the idea that one owns the result of their labor. For example, if one picks an apple off of a tree, they own the appleit is all, really, quite logical and practical.1 Nowadays, when we do labor, we typically get paid with money, which is one form of property.
Biologically, humans will try to acquire as much property as they can so that they can live long and reproduce.2 This is the basic science of natural selection that has given humanity its success.
Societies have long recognized that they can take advantage of this instinctual desire to acquire. By

rewarding its citizens with property, society incentivizes contributions to the collective good. Individuals get rewarded with money, a clever little invention, when they benefit others. Consequently, our individual contributions to society are measured by money and property.
This economic truth that has characterized human society tells us to pursue property for ourselves. By doing this, we dont just benefit ourselves as

individuals, we are helping everyone. In fact, it is better to look after ourselves most of all, as this is the most efficient way to do good. As the Russian saying goes, If you chase two hares, youll catch neither.3 The more people you try to help, the less cumulative good you will do. From loving ourselves alone, we contribute the most to general advancement.4

Obituary
Semyon Marmeladov of St. Petersburg, Russia passed away in the afternoon hours, March 2, 1866. Born on May 15, 1823, he was a civil servant before his unfortunate weakness (which was not his fault)1 brought him troubles. As his daughter, I have seen much more than his alcoholism. His heart was full of love and kindness. He was a devoted husband to Katerina Ivanovna and to all his kids.2
He would often express his remorse for the mistakes he has made and tried his best to make amends.
Marmeladov, who was full of apologies in his last moments, died in my arms saying,

Sonya! My daughter! Forgive me!3 Of course, if you are seeing this Marmeladov, I forgive you! And I am sure that God will forgive you too! I will make sure to pray for you every day in hopes that He will make your afterlife even better.
Although you are gone father, your legacy lives on in me. You are a reminder of the power of forgiveness and kindness, even through the many challenges we face in our lives. Rest in peace, dear father, I will always carry your memory in my heart.

On Human Connection
Our actions are guided by three parts of the soul: reason, appetite, and spirit.1 Reason is the rational part, appetite is responsible for our pursuit of pleasure and sensual desires, and spirit is what gives us courage and willpower. The healthy, harmonious soul must live with a balance of these three parts.
For much of a life, my appetite has taken over my soul. Like an illness, I continuously sinned, I hurt others, and, in doing this, I damaged myself most of all. I have lived a life so nasty, disgusting, and offensive that no words could possibly describe.1 But I am not telling you this to make you pity me.	It wasnt
until recently that I realized that I needed more than the superficial pleasures that my appetite made me addicted to. I was degrading my life and soul into something so meaningless and pointless. My existence brought no value to the world. Without reason and spirit, I wondered, was I really living or was I merely existing? The solution to this problem, I realized, was love2something capable of restoring harmony between all three parts of the soul. It is through the powerful force of
love and human connection that we are driven to seek out the things that are of the most importance. Without love, life is not worth living.3

FOOTNOTES
On Crime
1 I sent [the article] to Weekly Discourses, not Periodical Discourses (283).
2 Crimes require the destruction
of the present order in the name of something better (286).
3 Everyone who is even
marginally capable of uttering some new word must [...] necessarily be criminals [...] Otherwise it would be difficult for them to break out of the rut (286).
4 Extraordinary people are those
who possess the gift or talent of uttering some new word in their milieu (286).
5 Ordinary people are material
serving solely for the purpose of reproducing the species (286). 6 [Y]ou insisted that the act of committing a crime is always accompanied by illness (284). 7 [T]hese people never get very
far [...] theyll beat themselves up because theyre so well behaved. Some will provide this service to others, and some will do it to themselves (288).
8 I dont insist in any way that
extraordinary people absolutely must and are always obligated to commit all sorts of outrages (285).
9 If the lives of one, ten, or a
hundred, and so on, people [interfere with] discoveries or [are] obstacles, an extraordinary individual has the right to kill anyone and everyone he pleased, or to rob people everyday at the market (285).
10 This has all been written and
read a thousand times (286).
11 Of course, they didnt hesitate even to shed blood, if that blood [...] would help them (285).
12 [T]he lawgivers and
trailblazers of humanity, beginning with the ancients, continuing with Lycurgus, the Solons, Mohammeds, Napoleons, and so forth, each and everyone one of them, were criminals (285).
13 I signed [the article] with only
my initials (284).
The Fallacy of the Ordinary and Extraordinary
1 your little article On Crime .
. . or whatever its called, I forgot its title, I cant recall it. Two months ago I had the pleasure of reading it in Periodical Discourses (283).
2 So, you still believe in New
Jerusalem? [...] Do you believe in God? [...] Do you believe in the raising of Lazarus (287)?
3 Well, come, come now, who
among us in Holy Rus doesnt consider himself a Napoleon these days (292)?
4 The sanctioning of bloodshed
as a matter of conscience; why, in my opinion, thats more terrible than an official or legal sanction to shed blood (289).
5 And what about his
conscience? What business is that of yours? Just so, out of human kindness (290).
6 this little idea of mine is so very
playful . . . and psychological. . . . Well then, when you were composing your little articlecould it possibly be the case, heh-heh, that you might also have considered yourself, even the tiniest bit, to be an extraordinary man uttering some new word, in the sense that youre using it. . . . Isnt that so? [...] And if so, then might you yourself have decided [...] to step over those obstacles? Say, for example, to kill and rob (291)?
Love Yourself
1 youre pleased, Avdotya Romanovna, to marry that practical, rational [...] efficient man (44-45)
2 Science tells us to love ourselves
first of all because everything on earth is based on personal interest (164)
3 If you chase two hares, youll
catch neither (164).
4 in acquiring solely and exclusively for myself, Im also acquiring for all (164)
On Human Connection
1 they enveloped him with a fiery and shameless look, they beckoned him, laughing. . . .
There was something infinitely disgusting and offensive in that laughter, in those eyes, in all the nastiness in the childs face (560). 2 he was able to figure out that she was an unloved child [...] He picked her up, carried her into his room, sat her on the bed, and began to undress her (559).
Svidrigailov feels bad for the girl and decides to give her the love that she never got. This shows a desire for human connection.
3 After Dunya tells Svidrigailov she
cant ever love him, A moment of terrible, mute struggle transpired in Svidrigaylovs soul [...] A strange smile distorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, one of desperation (546-547). Dunya makes him give up on his struggle and desperation for love and connection. Without Dunya and love, he realizes his life isnt worth living.
Love Yourself
1 it was afterward, when I lost my job, which wasnt my fault, but it happened because of the changes in the department that I turned to drink! (18).
2 Since that evening, when I
learned how devoted he was to you all, and especially how he respected and loved you, Katerina Ivanovna, in spite of his unfortunate weakness (205).
3 Sonya! My daughter! Forgive
me! (205).

His Long Quest to End
Race-Conscious College Admissions
ARGUMENT
I.Harvards Use of Race is Harmful For Minorities
Frederick Douglass once said, The American people have always been anxious to know what they shall do with us . . . . I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are worm-eaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! .
. . And if the negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone! . . . Your interference is doing him positive injury (Grutter v. Bollinger Thomas concurring).
The practice of affirmative action has long been used as an excuse to further a schools interest in increasing the diversity of the student body. Harvard Universitys usage of affirmative action, along with many colleges and universities across the nation, has become discriminatory, limiting, and frankly, ineffective over the years.
20 years ago, the Supreme Court decided on Grutter. In the case itself, the Court stressed the importance of keeping race-conscious admissions practices  affirmative action  as short-term as possible. The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today. (Grutter). It is almost 25 years since this decision was passed, and its clear that the efficacy of affirmative action admissions procedures has deteriorated. Moreover, negative effects of affirmative action have been and are being observed.
Racial classifications and race-conscious admissions policies do more harm than good, especially for the minorities it claims to protect and assist. As Mr. Justice Powell concludes, Racial and ethnic classifications of any sort are inherently suspect and call for the most exacting judicial scrutiny. (Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke). Supporters of racial classifications argue that its practices supposedly help to counteract racial discrimination. And yet, they fail to realize that what they themselves are supporting is discriminating and classifying on the basis of race. As Chief Justice Roberts put it, The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race. (Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1).
We are a Nation not of black and white alone, but one teeming with divergent communities knitted together by various traditions and carried forth, above all, by individuals. (Metro Broadcasting v. FCC). Affirmative action policies harm minorities, especially under-represented minorities, including by bringing doubts as to whether people of certain races belong and if they are not deserving of their place and by prioritizing one racial or ethnic group over another without a rational reason. To put things into perspective, at Harvard, for 45% of all admitted African American and Hispanic Applicants, race was the determinative factor (SFFA Brief).
There is no doubt that diversity, including racial diversity, is important to an incoming class of students. Yet, diversity is greater than the color of ones skin. As Ed Blum, the President of Students for Fair Admissions, states, African Americans are not interchangeable with one another. Whites are not interchangeable. Each individual should be judged as an individual, not as a representative of his or her racial or ethnic population (Time Interview). Our focus on achieving racial diversity has blinded us of the true diversity of the individual. Who is to say that a wealthy Latino student who
is a product of prep schools is more deserving of a place at a higher-level institution such as Harvard compared to a low-income child of Chinese immigrants living in Queens? Asians are not just one group made up of individuals who share the same cultural values and experiences. The experience of a student of Cambodian descent will inherently be different from a student with Korean parents. And why is a white child from rural Appalachia not given the same advantage a black student with two physicians as parents would get from affirmative action? As the SFFA v Harvard case is reviewed, one central question must be kept in mind: Why have we, as a nation, overlooked the value in differing experiences, traits, and cultural backgrounds of all individuals, and rather, have placed our focus and efforts into classifying students based on the color of their skin?
II.Discrimination Against Asian Americans
Harvard University has long since held a history of racial and ethnic classifications, and even quotas. In the 1920s and 30s, Harvard was disconcerted by the number of Jewish applicants and students, and sought to reduce that number quickly and quietly. Their solution was to create a new type of admissions system, one that is still in use today, where race was considered. In the previous 25 years, the Jewish student population at Harvard had increased from 7% to 25%. After the introduction of the new admissions policies of holistic review, that number dropped to below 15%.
SFFAs lawsuit against Harvard has unearthed evidence proving that the institutions race-conscious policies have actually disadvantaged and discriminated against Asian American applicants. One important fact to note is that the first written guidance Harvard provided to admissions officers on how to consider race when reviewing applications was given right before trial. The most startling data, however, has appeared regarding the disparities of the personal rating admissions officers give applicants. According to
Harvard, students who are reflective, insightful and/or dedicated should receive higher personal ratings as well. (SFFA Brief). Despite Asian American applicants having higher academic, extracurricular, and alumni interview scores, they are given the lowest personal rating scores.
The discrimination against Asian Americans can be further examined by looking at Harvards admit rates. Harvard arranges its applicants by an academic index where 10 is the highest and 1 is the lowest (see Figure 1 APPENDIX). To provide an example, an African American student in the 4th decile (fourth from the bottom) has a higher chance of being admitted than an Asian American student in the 10th decile (the highest).
Harvards race-conscious admissions policies have been negatively impacting minorities and discriminating against Asian American applicants for years.
III.Harvard Violates Strict Scrutiny
This case is concerned with the application of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964:
No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
Since Harvard receives federal funding, it is seemingly clear that Harvard cannot use race to help determine the admission of applications without violating Title VI. In Bakke, it was found that Title VI was actually just applying the 14th amendment to programs receiving federal funds. So, to find whether Harvard is violating Title VI, we must analyze whether Harvard is violating the 14th amendment with its use of racial classifications.
Due to Harvards use of racial classifications, strict scrutiny must be used to review whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest (Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea). This analysis requires a most searching examination (Adarand) because racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification (Gratz v. Bollinger).
There are two main interests that a university might have in using racial classifications for admissions. The first interest is a remedial interest. Here, a university would give an advantage to groups who have historically been discriminated against to remedy past discrimination. However, this interest has repeatedly failed to survive strict scrutiny:
[A]n effort to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest (City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co).
Societal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy (Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education).
[A] governmental agencys interest in remedying societal discrimination, that is, discrimination not traceable to its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass constitutional muster (Wygant OConnor concurring opinion).
So, Harvards use of racial classifications in the admissions process cannot be justified by the desire to counteract this nations discriminatory past through remedy.
The other main interest Harvard might have in using racial classifications is the interest in having a diverse student body. Such an interest may only be pursued if the use of race is narrowly tailored to fit that interest. The diversity interest involves achieving exposure to widely diverse people, cultures,  ideas,  and  viewpoints  (Grutter).  Since  true
diversity encompasses so many different aspects of individuals, it would not make sense to make race a highly determinative and decisive factor (Parents Involved). Doing so would employ only a limited notion of diversity (Parents Involved) and would fail to have the highly individualized, holistic review that Grutter requires. To make sure Harvards use of race is narrowly tailored, this Court must ensure that the use of racial classifications [are] indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, not simply an effort to achieve racial balance, which [...] would be patently unconstitutional (Parents Involved). Race must play a small role in the application process in order for it to be considered merely a 'plus in a particular applicants file (Bakke).
Harvards admissions process is not the highly individualized, holistic review it claims to be. Instead, racial classifications are relied on in a nonindividualzed, mechanical way (Gratz OConnor concurring). Harvard is obsessed with race. This obsession starts at the very beginning of the admissions process: recruiting. To be invited to apply to Harvard, white and Asian-American applicants must score at least 1310 on the PSAT while African-American and Hispanic students must score at least 1100. After applications are sent to Harvard, the racial makeup of the class is closely monitored, and admissions officers are regularly informed about the racial statistics of the class. The effects of this monitoring can be summarized by the consistency of the racial makeup of admitted classes (see Figure 1 APPENDIX).
The obsession Harvard has with engineering the racial composition of its classes can also be summarized by the large amount of time and money Harvard is spending on this court case. To Harvard, race isnt a plus factor, it is much closer to being the factor (Parents Involved). Disparities in Harvards overall personal rating summarizes how much of a
determinative factor it is in the admissions process (see
Figure 3 APPENDIX).
There are great costs associated with the use of the racial classification. Such classifications promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility, (Croson), reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin, (Shaw v. Reno), and endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict (Metro Broadcasting). One of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities (Rice v. Cayetano).
Upholding Harvards unconstitutional use of racial classifications and perpetuating the use of such classifications would have devastating impacts on this nation. It would effectively assur[e] that race will always be relevant in American life, and that the ultimate goal of eliminating entirely from governmental decision making such irrelevant factors as a human beings race will never be achieved (Parents Involved). Perpetuating the use of race will do no more than move us from separate but equal to unequal but benign' (Metro Broadcasting Kennedy dissent).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse judgement on this case.

The Use of Tragedy
Aristotle defines the purpose of tragedy as effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions, a phenomenon known as catharsis (Aristotle 10). Although the evocation of pity and fear is required for a plot to be considered tragic, neither the main use of tragic plots nor the pleasure from them is based in catharsis. Tragic plots are instead used to communicate some lesson or moral to the audience. Aristotelian tragedy enforces societal status quo and standards by basing a characters hamartia on their hubris. 
In Aristotelian tragedy, hamartia is the error that a character performs that leads them to catastrophic outcomes. The characters who make these errors are referred to as tragic heroes and are described by Aristotle to be the sort of person who is not outstanding in moral excellence or justice, yet their change to bad fortune [...] is not due to any moral defect or depravity, but to an error of some kind (Aristotle 21). This means that the characters must be of some moral grace. Aristotle later elaborates on character creation and guides that, Since tragedy is an imitation of people better than we are, one should imitate good portrait-painters. In rendering the individual from, they paint people as they are, but make them better looking (Aristotle 25). We know from Aristotles description that tragic heroes must be naturally good and cannot error based on flaws of their nature but rather on erroneous beliefs they hold. These erroneous beliefs are the hubris, the insolent daring to overstep cultural codes, that leads characters to their erroneous actions. Similar to the connotations of pride, hubris comes with a level of self assurance in ones actions or possible actions, and a lack of care or judgment that leads to mistakes. We can see the process of hubris triggering hamartia in two classic tragedies written around 2000 years apart: Oedipus the King, written by Sophocles around 425 BCE, and The Tragedy of Macbeth, written by William Shakespeare around 1606 CE.
Aristotle references Sophocles' work, Oedipus the King, multiple times when giving examples of the best executed tragedies. With Oedipus the King as a standard for what a tragedy, and by extension, a tragic hero, should look like, we can observe the relationship of hubris and hamartia. Oedipus the King follows Oedipus, the king of Thebes, a man cursed to kill his father and sleep with his mother, as he discovers that he fulfilled the prophecy set out for him despite his efforts to evade it. A plague strikes Thebes, leading Oedipus to seek the root of the disease to deracinate it. Once finding that the cause is murder, Oedipus calls for the blind man blessed with Apollo's eyes to reveal the murderer. Acquiescing to the request, the seer reveals that Oedipus is the murderer, leading Oedipus to lash out and claim that the seer is faking his sight. He tells the seer, You can't hurt me or anyone else who sees the light you can never touch me (Sophocles 181). By committing such a taboo act as insulting the seer, Oedipus demonstrates that his faith has shifted away from the gods by which the seer is blessed.  Additionally, at the time the play is set, people believed that natural disasters were sent by gods when the leaders of the society were tainted. This means that Oedipus not only insults the seer, but he also refuses to believe the most likely story according to common belief, that he, the leader, is the cause of the plague. In his self assurance, he commits acts taboo in society, clearly demonstrating his hubris. 
Oedipus refusal to believe the seer leads him to investigate the murder further and discover that he killed his father and slept with his mother. On his search for truth, Oedipus reveals that Apollos prophet at Delphi told Oedipus of his fate but was spurned when he demanded more information (Sophocles 205). Despite the prophet rebuffing Oedipus, he continued to claim himself Apollos champion (Sophocles 167). Through the revelation of his previous encounter with another seer, we can see that Oedipus consistently gives little sway to prophets.  In the case of both the blind seer and the prophet at Delphi,  Oedipus denied the evidence provided by the speakers of Apollo that he is not cherished by the gods as he is cursed to a wicked fate. The hubris to deny the socially esteemed speakers led Oedipus on his path of hamartia to fulfill his fate. 
Oedipuss mother-wife, Jocasta, exhibits hubris in the same form, by denying prophets. She believes that Not a man on earth can see a day ahead, because she believes that she avoided the fate handed to her on Delphi to bear a son that would kill his father and marry her (Sophocles 215). Her belief that she could avoid her fate spurred her attempted infanticide, which caused Oedipus to be adopted into another kingdom.. With both Jocasta and Oedipus, the character triggers their fate in attempting to evade it. These attempts are caused by the belief that the fate set out for them by the gods is avoidable, but avoiding fate is impossible because such avoidance would indicate that the gods rules are not absolute. Oedipus and Jocasta believed that they may evade their fate despite the gods, and this hubris leads them to hamaritas that invoke their fate and their cosmic payback, nemesis.
Over 2000 years later, in William Shakespeares Macbeth, we can still see the causal relationship between hubris and hamartia. Macbeth is the tragedy of a Scottish lord and lady who are fed a prophecy that leads them to kill the king in order to gain dominion. Their wicked actions later lead them to insanity and ruin. Near the beginning of the play, Macbeth, along with his best friend and kinsman, Banquo, encounter three witches who prophesize that Macbeth will increase in rank to become King of Scotland. Macbeth is skeptical as witches are known to be ill intentioned, but when he is named Thane of Cawdor in addition to his Thane of Glamis, he begins to trust the witches. Banquo warns Macbeth against trusting witches though because oftentimes, to win us to our harm, / The instruments of darkness tell us truths, / Win us with honest trifles, to betray s (Shakespeare 1.3.135-137). Macbeth considers this warning yet is unconvinced that the witches are vile in their intentions toward him as their prophecies are so agreeable. Upon telling his wife, Lady Macbeth, of the fortune, she convinces him to kill the king for his fate. He fears the consequences though, to which she tells him to screw [his] courage to the sticking place, so that he may act on his desires without going mad (Shakespeare 1.7.70). By trusting in the witches, the couple shows their unjust self assurance, believing that they are out of wicked intentions purview. Their hubris lets Macbeth and Lady Macbeth act on the witches sayings and leads them to dominion, but also leads them down the path of insanity with each person killed. 
Insanity breeds paranoia, and Macbeth soon has nowhere to turn so is guided back to the witches. From the second interaction with the witches, he is told to Beware Macduff, but also  that none of woman born / Shall harm Macbeth (Shakespeare 4.1.81, 4.1.91-92). The first portion of prophecy leads Macbeth to slaughter the family of Macduff, giving Macduff a personal vendetta against him, and being the final strand in Lady Macbeths noose. Macbeth proceeds carelessly when the castle is under siege from a coup due to the second prophecy, allowing Macduff to kill him. Macbeth, trusting the witches despite the understanding that they are wicked and despite warnings from Banquo, shows great the hubris that leads him to his actions, and he is driven to insanity by his hamartia and eventually killed. 
 Aristotle states that the function of the poet is to say the kind of thing that would happen, i.e. what is possible in accordance with probability or necessity, and he describes poetry as more philosophical and more serious than history (Aristotle 16). This is because poetry aims at demonstrating universals, defined similarly to morals, rather than particulars, leading peotry to be more of an exercise in philosophical ideation rather than historical research. This aim of poetry to express universals, and the understanding that hubris, a breaking of social standards, is the cause of tragedy tells us that tragedy aims to express the importance of societal morals. The use of tragedy must not then be to deliver a new philosophical idea to an audience, but to reaffirm a preexisting one.

Sylvestre Ramsarans Speech
You all know who I am and that I have always been devoutly religious and dedicated to my farm and family my whole life.[1] While this wake is unfortunately necessary, I dont understand everyone's morose attitude. This man, Francis Sancher, brought nothing positive into this world even before the two pregnancies of Mira and my own daughter Vilma. Before all of this drama, Francis Sancher had never even crossed my mind.[2] We are all much too busy and important to mope over this good for nothing man. We have real lives to get back to. Lets just make this go as quickly as possible and get along with our lives and the consequences of that dead fool. As for the girls, what compassion should they get? They knew what they were doing and got what they deserved.[3] Now they are only dragging others into the fray through association. They are like my diseased limes that I have here: weak and fickle but a good representation of our modern era.[4] What are we to do with girls such as these? Despite all the speculation and intrigue, I dont really care how this old man died. He was insignificant before everything, a drunk fool, and should die just as forgettably. Whatever the manner, whether natural or purposeful, justice has been served. I can only smile at justice sent from above, whether or not it is appropriate.[5] While I feel renewed by the end of this whole affair, I am still forced to deal with the aftermath through tradition and social mores. What am I going to do with Vilma and her child, my grandchild?[6] Perhaps it is better though for the child to be fatherless than born with a father as crazy as Francis Sacher. Honestly, I have never been very concerned with the lives of either of my daughters, alive or dead, I dont think I will start now.[7] If you all are really so curious, you can ask her mother, I have four other children to worry about. Life goes on even through death. I have so many other more pressing issues. I have to raise my sons and figure out what to do with my struggling farm.  There is no other man better to die than Francis Sacher, let us just be grateful it was him instead of us. This grief is pointless for the death of a man so insignificant yet somehow so bothersome. Save it for those who really matter. Now if youll all excuse me, allow me to take my lime and get back to the important people of this world.
------------------------------------------------------------
[1] It was to erase those images that Sylvestre had become a fervent Hindu (107). 
[2] Until Francis Sancher had seduced his daughter, Sylvestre Ramsaran had never given him a second thought (108-9).
[3] Not long after that Sylvestre had heard about Miras rape and, devoid of compassion, had said to himself deep down that by hanging around in gullies she had reaped what she had sown (110).
[4] Then a disease had attacked his experimental plantation of limes. New crops were as fragile and capricious as young girls (109).
[5]  At the thought of justice sent from heaven without having to go and fetch it, Sykcestre Ramsaran couldnt help smirking triumphantly, although it was hardly fitting at a deathbed (104).
[6] What was he going to do with the papaless child who would soon open its eyes to the world? What was he going to do with Vilmas ruined youth? (110).
[7] However, he had always considered Vilma as belonging to Rosa and had kept himself at a discreet distance from the circle of women (108). Nell Marcus Mari OMeara

Tragic Womanhood: The Female Body in Oedipus The King and Macbeth
Jurisdiction over female reproduction is a primary mechanism of patriarchal control.
Considered vassals of the men in their life, women have historically been systematically1 denied ownership and control of their own bodies. For centuries, societal, religious, and social structures have dictated when, where, and how women get pregnant and give birth. This dynamic can be traced in the subtext of literature and art across history and is especially present in the heavily male-dominated genre of classical tragedy. In the time of Shakespeare equally as in the time of Sophocles, female bodies were subject to the whims and wants of the fathers and husbands of which they were considered property. From Oedipus of Sophocles Oedipus The King to Macbeth of Shakespeares Macbeth, male tragic heroes are not without female companions. But unlike their male counterparts, the women of Oedipus Rex and Macbeth, Jocasta and Lady Macbeth respectively, are uniquely defined by the use and commandeering of their bodies.
In Oedipus The King, Queen Jocasta and King Laius of Thebes are told by the Oracle of Delphi that they are destined to have a child that will kill his father and marry his mother. This child, Oedipus, is the tragic hero of the story. Oedipus' ultimate end, to kill his father and marry his mother, is certainly tragic. But what of Jocastas fate: to give birth to a child and later bear that childs children? What of her body, which is forced to house children of immoral and unnatural birth? Jocastas loss of bodily autonomy is essential to the tragic plot of Oedipus the King. Sophocles chides his protagonist for his hubris, his belief that he can overcome his fate.
1 Unit 5
As Creon, Jocastas brother and Oedipus' uncle, tells Oedipus: [y]ou will go too far. Its perfect justice: natures like yours are hardest on themselves (Sophocles 198). Stated simply, Oedipus tragic fate is a consequence of his own actions. But this message cannot be applied to Jocasta, Oedipus' mother and wife, whose body is thrown to the winds of fate. The perversion of Jocastas body cannot be framed as a natural consequence of her own hamartia, or fatal mistake, because her mistake arises not from hubris but from necessity. What is often recognized as Jocastas hubris, her attempt to kill her baby and thus escape her destiny to have his children, is based not on pride but on fear. As the shepherd, who took Oedipus to Mount Cithaeron on Jocastas orders, explains, [s]he was afraidfrightening prophecies (Sophocles 231). These frightening prophecies spelled a fate so horrible that she had no choice, for the sake of her own sanctity, for the sake of her own body, but to try and avoid them. Her attempt to kill her baby, Oedipus, is a desperate but futile endeavor to gain a kind of control she never really hadthat which pertains to her body and reproduction.
Lady Macbeth of Macbeth, equally desperate for bodily autonomy, attempts to gain control over her husband in order to control herself. She, as a woman, is entirely dependent on the actions and status of her husband, the overly ambitious and unstable Macbeth. As such, when she sees the opportunity for a better life as queen of Scotland in the form of the witches prophecy, she does everything she can to control Macbeths actions and thus improve her own life. In doing so, she subverts ideas of traditional relationship dynamics between men and women, and yet her actions remain firmly rooted in the reality that she is unable to control her destiny for herself. As Macbeth becomes more and more consumed by guilt, and as Lady Macbeths dream slips farther out of reach, she clamors to get him to act as she wishes. Be so much more the man Lady Macbeth tells Macbeth (Shakespeare 1.7.58). Of herself, she says I
have given suck, and know/How tender tis to love the babe that milks me./I would, while it was smiling in my face,/Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums/And dashed the brains out (Shakespeare 1.7.62-66). This condemnation and subversion of femininity and reproduction is a theme in Shakespeares characterization of Lady Macbeth. In her belief, it is only through the denial of her femininity that she can achieve her ends. She states it resolutely:
[U]nsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direct cruelty. Make thick my blood.
Stop up th access and passage to remorse, That make no compunctions visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between Th effect and it. Come to my womans breasts
And take my milk for gall, you murdring ministers Wherever in your slightless substances
You wait on natures mischief. Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry Hold, hold! (Shakespeare 1.5.45-61)
The fact that Lady Macbeth views the literal removal of her reproductive organs as the key to the power she craves is demonstrative of the cultural hegemony surrounding womens bodies; which dictates that women, as mothers, are weak and soft in nature. In order to be free from these
conceptions, and also literally free from the body that keeps her from actualizing her goals, she seeks to purge herself of femininity.
Ultimately though, what Lady Macbeth seeks is impossible. She is irrevocably trapped as a woman, controlled by society, her husband, and the tragic plot. Even Macbeths best compliment is only related to Lady Macbeth insofar as it is to her womb: [b]ring forth
men-children only,/For thy undaunted mettle should compose/Nothing but males (Shakespeare 1.7.83-85). The only feasible act of control, then, the only way Lady Macbeth can physically change the function of her body, is suicide. Lady Macbeth first descends into madness and guilt, unable to rid herself of the image of Duncans blood. She sees her situation as inescapable. What, will these hands neer be clean? she asks, knowing that she is powerless to evade a tragic end (Shakespeare 5.1.45). This is true too for Jocasta, who also ends her life after the truth of Oedipus' birth is revealed. She can no longer bear to live her life as a passenger[...] in the grip of fear, watching the pilot of the vessel go to pieces (Sophocles 211). For both Jocasta and Lady Macbeth, suicide proves to be the only way they can end the torment and puppeteering of their reproductive organs: the only way to gain any semblance of control over their lives is to end them.
Both Lady Macbeth and Jocasta represent the power struggle that typifies the female experience throughout history. An Aristotelian tragic hero is likewise tormented. He comes to realize that he has landed himself in a horrible, inescapable situation; simply a pawn in fates great plan. Wasnt I born for torment? Oedipus asks (Sophocles 206). Perhaps he was. But so too was Jocasta, his mother and wife. So too was her body, which wrought her own tragic fate. The difference, of course, is that this control is not dependent on some terrifying prophecy. The same is true for Lady Macbeth, whose husband, having fallen to the perils of ambition, states:
[l]ifes but a walking shadow, a poor player/That struts and frets his hour upon the stage/And then is heard no more. It is a tale/Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing (Shakespeare 5.5.27-31). But Lady Macbeth surely lives an equally meaningless life, at the mercy of the will of others. Thus in both cases our male tragic hero and female lead find themselves in the same position: tormented and powerless. But Oedipus and Macbeth meet their respective ends as a direct consequence of their own actions. Lady Macbeth and Jocasta are, conversely, led to commit suicide by the material reality of a condition outside of their control: their own sex. Their fate is reflective of the continual persecution of women under a patriarchal society, which works to trap the female population into a perpetual state of immovable inferiority. This, the reality of womanhood, proves tragic enough in and of itself.

Question: Which is the better title: Black Moses or Little Pepper?
Black Moses is the better title. 
How do authors title their works and what makes a good or great title? Alain Mabanckou wrote the picaresque novel Petit Piment in French in 2015. The novel was later translated into English by Helen Stevenson in 2017, but rather than simply translating the title from French to English (Petit Piment to Little Pepper), Stevenson renamed the novel, Black Moses. The picaresque novel follows the life of an orphan in the Republic of the Congo from the 1960s to 40 years later in the 2000s, a period and place in which a communist revolution was taking place. The orphans name is Moses, and we follow him on a journey of self discovery out of his orphanage, to the port city of Pointe-Noire, and back to the site of the orphanage, though it was converted into a mental asylum. This journey mirrors that of Moses in many ways and begins and ends with Moses given name. Black Moses makes more sense as the title of this book than Little Pepper does, because the name Moses and the religious allusions to the story of Moses are integral to the book.
	The novel begins with Moses explaining that It all began when I was a teenager, and came to wonder about the name Id been given by Papa Moupelo, a name that roughly means Thanks be to God, the black Moses is born on the earth of our ancestors, and is so long that it is abbreviated to just Moses (3). Moses has ambivalent feelings about his name, enjoying the significance, but fearing that he is not the true Moses and God will not reach out to him like Papa Moupelo described. Moses considers asking Papa Moupelo about Moses name, but does not get the chance as the revolution occurs and Papa Moupelo is not allowed to teach at the orphanage anymore.  The weight that accompanies the name Moses, given to him by Papa Moupelo, makes the removal of Papa Moupelo more difficult for Moses and compels him to search in other places  outside the orphanage  for the significance of his name. 
	After leaving the orphanage in Loango, Moses begins going by Little Pepper after it becomes the nickname that those in Pointe-Noire call him. However, Little Pepper is not necessarily what he wants to be called nor is it an identity for him. When visiting the first doctor, Moses is asked his name, to which he responds that it is Little Pepper, but the doctor specifies that he is asking for Moses family name, and Moses informs him that That's what people call [him], and if you havent got a family theres no point in having a family name, and also elaborates that he would have liked a nice name such as Robin Hood (168). We can see then that the nickname Little Pepper' could be supplemented by some other nickname without much change in the progression of the story as Little Pepper is simply what he is called, not his name.
	Near the end of the novel, Moses returns to and accepts his name since he finally feels that he deserve[s] this name because he had liberated Pointe-Noire from the corrupt mayor (197). This acceptance and identification at the end of the novel connects Moses narrative arc through surviving in Pointe-Noire with his starting struggle with his name in the Loango orphanage. Without the name Moses, the events of the story would not have been as well connected, nor would they have necessarily been possible as the book follows the original story of Moses.
	Moses is an irreplaceable name and concept in the book. With the title Black Moses, the reader is primed to consider the story of Moses and the religious allusions littered through this journey of identity. Like Moses, the biblical character, Moses questions his importance to God and is reassured, goes into an exile of wandering without purpose for many years, and finally kills a man he finds to be evil when he is 40 years old. The reader may not notice the parallels between this novel and the story of Moses without the title preparing them to identify the nuances of both stories.Clifford the big red dog: Arlie, as you probably know the topic of education is an important one that must be discussed, but i'm curious, dear sir what you think an ideal education system is?
 
Arlie: I had no idea you took interest in the philosophy of school structure Clifford, but indeed it is an important question to ask. We can then wonder if a reformed school system would increase the success rates out of school because of it.
 
Clifford: That is indeed something to put thought into, for when a structure changes, oftentimes the outcome does too.
 
Arlie: To understand what needs to change, we need to know what it is now. Schooling before college exists to train students in intellectually challenging courses to build their minds for the future, so they can handle equally intellectually challenging problems. Schools don't teach you math to become a mathematician, school teaches you math to learn the extent of problem solving, which is what math is when you boil it down to its bare minimum.
 
Clifford: Well, couldn't you also say that school teaches you core subjects because careers stem from what they teach you? Math can teach you to become an engineer, English can teach you to become a public speaker, could this be schools wanting to train you in skills for jobs they see society needing the most?
 
Arlie: This could be a possibility, Clifford, a brain surgeon cannot be a brain surgeon without science. But what about, let's say, programming. In a broad sense schools do not teach programming, even though it is a necessary (and well paid) job that in today's society is necessary, disproving your first point. The same core subjects have been taught for ages now, even as society continues on. 
 
Clifford: I see your point, You only seem to draw on the idea of mathematics, but what could that mean for classes like language? What about for classes like english? 
 
Arlie: Well back to my previous idea about core classes teaching you problem solving, (for english we can assume that teaches you to have a stronger way of word), I do not believe this is the ideal way of study in education. For unless a child enjoys what makes up a specific subject, such as language, they might dislike it and even hate it because they are not learning something they see will benefit their future, and in most senses, especially in high school their future relies on the comfortability of the career they choose. As Plato said in The Republic, Do not train children to learn by force and harshness, but direct them to it by what amuses their minds. Children and teens cannot learn things they do not want to, and if you do it by force, they will just forget it later as it has no relevance to their future.
 
Clifford: Are you suggesting that we drop the standard structure of schooling in favor for one that caters towards students' individual wants/ needs? Wouldn't that be impossible considering how vast the things people want to do are? Finding teachers, making them understand everyone's individual interests? That's impossible.
 
Arlie: My dear big red dog, your first point enforces my own, there are too many things people want to achieve in life, so how can we even think to teach in such a narrow minded way? While for physical activities like dance, we can incorporate that into our physical education, schools can put more funding into bringing in speakers and creating activities even online for specific people's wants. We do not need to stray away for the current structure, just allow more time for children to pursue their interests early on, and encourage growth within it.
 
Clifford: ah, I see, as Plato said,   But we would not allow our shoemaker to try to be also a farmer or weaver or builder, because we wanted our shoes well made. in the republic. You suggest we incorporate what children want into normal curriculum, and perhaps having days, maybe once a week, where speakers are brought in to talk about certain careers and subjects?
 
Arlie: That is ideal, yes. To be the best shoe maker, the student has to incorporate learning at a young age, for experience comes with time and repeated process. If the student feels theyre schooling is going to a subject that will benefit in their future, the rest of their education becomes easier. Practical schooling.
 
Clifford: Are you suggesting that normal classes that challenge students intellectually, as you mentioned before, should be completely obsolete and we should focus purely on what the student wants? As you said these core classes build thinking skills, so what would school be without them? Life beyond work still requires problem solving, critical thinking, etc. 
 
Arlie: I see your deep intellectual studies outside of working as a childs size distorting dog has paid off. Just taking up a shield or other weapon will not make a man capable of fighting that very day in any sort of warfare as Plato said in the republic. These core studies are necessary for that fundamental knowledge of reasoning and critical thinking that we as people need to thrive in society, as you make in your point. Education is a clock and without one piece the whole thing falls apart. Some parts are more important, like the face that actually tells the time, but it takes all of them working together to make it work.
 
Clifford: You are very wise. That is not saying much considering I am a dog.

Attempts to frame Bereaved Woman for Theft.

common justifications for criminal activities are desperation, passion, and avarice, but I believe the root cause that underlies all of them is certain sickness of body and character that compels these actions.2
The sickness behind this failure of will and reason is developed gradually and reach[es] its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease.3 Further crimes may be committed past the criminals recovery, as the individual attempts to rectify the errors committed in the grips of this mania. As for the onset of this sickness, I suspect that it takes place primarily in the mind due to an imbalance of passions. Those common motives ascribed to crime are likely aggravating factors, and compound upon each other in producing susceptibility to the illness. I remain unsure whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease4, or, to put it more simply, whether the thoughts and preparations for the crime are the true source of the disease, rather than a symptom.

psychological profile that, with minor variations, remained largely consistent across the criminals assessed in this way. (To clarify for the reader, I excluded those liable solely for petty crimes, as minor transgressions are a frequent enough occurrence for all minds to make these virtually insignificant.) These criminals often describe a building resentment or fixation on the victim or subject developing prior to the perpetration of the crime. Whether or not the crime was premeditated or induced with seeming spontaneity, the criminal held the seed of the action in their head prior to the crime. The actual moment of the crime is marked by a panicked and excited state, in which a criminal is rarely able to react to unexpected variables in a rational manner, and often errs in the more complicated processes of even premeditated crimes. After the conclusion of the crime, the mind of the criminal seems to drift back towards rationality, but that obsessive focus takes longer to abate, as it is turned back onto the investigation into the crime. This actually serves to aid the investigators, as the criminals fixation on them ends up revealing ample clues that can lead to a conviction.

which a multitude of great men written about in the histories are placed, those for whom abeyance to law is unnatural and all but impossible. All the lawgivers and Trailblazers of humanity, beginning with the ancients, continuing with Lycurgus, the Solons, Mohammeds, Napoleons, and so forth, each and every one of them were criminal, just by virtue of the fact that in propagating new laws, they were at the same time destroying the old laws viewed as sacred by society and handed down by their fathers.5 Regardless of how one feels about these figures, their lawlessness had a profound and immeasurable effect on society. These extraordinary exceptions are not only justified in their actions, but for each in the process of executing his idea, he possesses a certain right to permit his conscience to overstep various obstacles6. These actions remain criminal, but their justification is on a different level than the baseness of an ordinary crime. I suspect these examples were underrepresented in the accounts I assessed, largely because these extraordinary individuals, committing their transgressions with clarity of mind, would be much less likely to be caught in the first place and show up in these accounts.
Response to ON CRIME
Porfiry Petrovich
Since the publication of this article I have had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of the author, a fine young man flush with youthful, incorruptible pride, and the audacity of despair1. After discussing this work at length, I decided to publish a response for two primary reasons; one, to elucidate and expound upon the thought presented in the articles conclusion, and two, to provide some of my own commentary regarding this philosophy.
The author makes a rather bold statement in his declaration that certain extraordinary individuals have the right to permit [their] conscience to overstep various obstacles2. Upon further discussion, he clarified to me that it in no way follows that [these extraordinary people] had the right to kill anyone and everyone3, only that the person possesses the right to do what is needed to make their extraordinary impact on the world. He defended this premise further when pressed about the possibility that an ordinary person might attempt to overstep their position and commit crimes, saying that while this is not uncommon, they will beat themselves up because they are so well behaved4 and that this is a primary function of law in his view...
